## Session log

(Append a dated entry per session; record what was done, what's next, any decisions made.)

### 2026-04-25 — Plan authored

- Loaded context: CLAUDE.md, architecture.md, docs/spec-context.md, tasks/current-focus.md, the audit remediation spec in full, and confirmed gate-script paths.
- Decomposed the spec's 5 phases into 8 chunks following the spec's §2.6 PR boundaries (Phases 1–4 each one PR; Phase 5A §8.1 split into 2 PRs; §8.2 separate; Phase 5B as a fan-out chunk with multiple optional PRs).
- Wrote `tasks/builds/audit-remediation/plan.md` and this `progress.md`.
- **Next:** human review of `plan.md`. After review, switch to Sonnet and begin Chunk 1 via `superpowers:executing-plans` (per CLAUDE.md plan gate convention).

## Decisions log

(Record any architectural or scoping decisions made during execution that diverge from the spec. Each entry should reference the spec section.)

## Deferred items captured during execution

(When a chunk's PR review or `spec-conformance` run routes items to `tasks/todo.md`, mirror the high-level summary here so this file remains the single source of truth for build state. The detailed entries live in `tasks/todo.md`.)

## Audit closure status

Rollup of items routed to `tasks/todo.md` from the original audit and any subsequent re-runs. Updated as items move between states. Filter source: `tasks/todo.md` entries tagged `[origin:audit:<scope>:<timestamp>]`. See `tasks/review-logs/README.md` § *Item format — origin tag + status*.

| Audit (origin) | Open | In progress | Resolved | Won't fix | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `audit:full:2026-04-25T07-09-00Z` (full audit, 47+16) | TBD | 0 | 0 | 0 | TBD |

(Update the row counts when triaging audit findings into chunks. A new row is added per re-run.)

## Programme completion checklist (from spec §13.6)

- [ ] All five phase DoDs satisfied (Chunks 1–7 ship gates green; Chunk 8 items landed or deferred).
- [ ] Every audit finding (P3-C1 … P3-L10) is either resolved or appears in spec §14 Deferred Items with operator sign-off.
- [ ] A retro entry has been added to `KNOWLEDGE.md` summarising what shipped, what deferred, and what changed in the gate baselines.
- [ ] `tasks/current-focus.md` is updated to reflect the programme's completion and unblocks feature development.

The operator owns the decision to declare the programme complete.
