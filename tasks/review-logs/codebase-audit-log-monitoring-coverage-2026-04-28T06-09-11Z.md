# Codebase Audit — System Monitoring Coverage

**Scope:** Targeted audit (two passes)
1. **Audit A** — does the System Monitor agent have everything it needs to read evidence, form diagnoses, and emit Investigate-Fix prompts?
2. **Audit B** — is every action surface in the codebase (skills, agents, automations, jobs, webhooks, sysadmin/org-user/sub-account operations) instrumented so that failures or potential issues become visible to the System Monitor agent?

**Mode:** Audit only (per `docs/codebase-audit-framework.md` three-pass model). No code changes in this log. Findings + recommendations only — implementation routed to `tasks/todo.md` once the user signs off.

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Branch:** `claude/add-monitoring-logging-3xMKQ`
**Source documents consulted:**
- `tasks/builds/system-monitoring-agent/phase-0-spec.md`
- `tasks/builds/system-monitoring-agent/phase-A-1-2-spec.md`
- `tasks/builds/system-monitoring-agent-fixes/spec.md`
- `tasks/post-merge-system-monitor.md`
- `architecture.md` § System Monitor (Phase 0 + 0.5)
- All `recordIncident` call sites + all pg-boss queue registrations across `server/`
