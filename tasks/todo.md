## Audit Summary

Full audit of routes, services, DB schema, client-side code, auth/security, and config.

### Critical Findings (Must Fix Before Testing)

| # | Category | Issue | Location | Severity |
|---|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **Routes** | ~145 routes across 25 files use manual try/catch instead of `asyncHandler` | `server/routes/*` | CRITICAL |
| 2 | **Org Scoping** | `skillService.getSkill()` and `getSkillBySlug()` don't filter by organisationId | `server/services/skillService.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 3 | **Org Scoping** | `fileService.downloadFile()` doesn't scope file lookup by org | `server/services/fileService.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 4 | **Org Scoping** | `taskService` activities query lacks organisationId filter | `server/services/taskService.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 5 | **Soft Delete** | `skillService` queries don't filter `isNull(deletedAt)` | `server/services/skillService.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 6 | **Schema** | `processes.organisationId` is nullable — should be `.notNull()` | `server/db/schema/processes.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 7 | **TypeScript** | `HeartbeatEditor.tsx` uses `clientWidth` on `DOMRect` (wrong API) | `client/src/components/HeartbeatEditor.tsx:75` | HIGH |
| 8 | **TypeScript** | `AdminAgentEditPage.tsx` passes wrong props to component | `client/src/pages/AdminAgentEditPage.tsx:1035` | HIGH |
| 9 | **Transactions** | `reviewService` updates actions + reviewItems without transaction | `server/services/reviewService.ts` | HIGH |
| 10 | **JSON Parse** | Unsafe `JSON.parse()` without try/catch in `executions.ts` route | `server/routes/executions.ts:54` | HIGH |
| 11 | **Hard Delete** | `taskService` hard-deletes deliverables instead of soft-delete | `server/services/taskService.ts` | HIGH |

### Important Findings (Should Fix)

| # | Category | Issue | Location | Severity |

| 12 | **Schema** | Missing `organisationId` indexes on agentTriggers, processConnectionMappings, processedResources, reviewItems | `server/db/schema/*` | MEDIUM |
| 13 | **Config** | `connectionTokenService` doesn't validate TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY on startup | `server/services/connectionTokenService.ts` | MEDIUM |
| 14 | **Client** | `OrgAdminGuard` in App.tsx has no role/permission check — just null check | `client/src/App.tsx:82-85` | MEDIUM |
| 15 | **Client** | No API request timeout configured on axios instance | `client/src/lib/api.ts` | MEDIUM |
| 16 | **Client** | 12+ API calls silently swallow errors with `.catch(() => {})` | `client/src/components/Layout.tsx` and pages | MEDIUM |
| 17 | **Error Format** | Inconsistent error throw formats across services (plain objects vs Error instances) | Multiple services | MEDIUM |
| 18 | **Race Condition** | Budget reservation in llmRouter lacks transaction protection | `server/services/llmRouter.ts` | MEDIUM |

### Security Findings (from auth/security audit)

| # | Category | Issue | Location | Severity |
|---|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| 19 | **Security** | Helmet CSP disabled — no Content-Security-Policy header | `server/index.ts:72-76` | HIGH |
| 20 | **Security** | CORS allows wildcard origins with credentials enabled | `server/index.ts:77-80` | HIGH |
| 21 | **Security** | In-memory rate limiting lost on restart; bypassed in multi-process | `server/routes/auth.ts:6-20` | HIGH |
| 22 | **Security** | Webhook auth optional — no HMAC validation if WEBHOOK_SECRET unset | `server/services/webhookService.ts:72-74` | HIGH |
| 23 | **Security** | System admin cross-org access via X-Organisation-Id has no audit trail | `server/middleware/auth.ts:42-48` | HIGH |
| 24 | **Security** | Multer memory storage accepts 500MB — OOM DoS risk | `server/middleware/validate.ts:16-19` | MEDIUM |

| 26 | **Security** | Error messages leak internal details to clients in production | `server/index.ts:149-153` | MEDIUM |
| 27 | **Security** | Missing security audit trail — no logging of auth/permission events | No centralized audit | MEDIUM |

### Noted (Lower Priority / Post-Testing)

- Route files exceeding 200-line limit: `subaccounts.ts` (758L), `permissionSets.ts` (587L), `llmUsage.ts` (524L), `portal.ts` (502L)
- Auth tokens stored in localStorage (XSS risk — migrate to httpOnly cookies later)
- No React ErrorBoundary component
- Silent promise rejections in `workspaceMemoryService.ts`
- Missing cascade delete rules on parent-child task/agent relationships
- Deprecated columns in agents schema (`sourceTemplateId`, `sourceTemplateVersion`)
- OAuth state JWT window too long (10 min, recommend 5 min)
- No refresh token rotation on OAuth integrations
- JWT session expiry at 24h with no forced logout on password change

## Hermes Tier 1 — Deferred Item (S1 from pr-reviewer)

**Captured**: 2026-04-21  
**Branch**: `claude/hermes-audit-tier-1-qzqlD`

### §6.8 errorMessage gap on normal-path failed runs

**File**: `server/services/agentExecutionService.ts` lines 1350-1368

When `finalStatus` is `'failed'` but the loop produces a non-empty `loopResult.summary` via the normal terminal path (not a thrown exception), `errorMessage: null` is passed to `extractRunInsights`. The §6.8 short-summary guard then falls back entirely to the `hasMeaningfulSummary >= 100` check. A failed run with a 50-char summary but no thrown exception gets its memory extraction skipped — even if `agent_runs.errorMessage` was set before the loop terminated.

**Why it's deferred**: Pre-existing limitation. Documented at lines 1355-1360 as known; acceptable per spec §11.4 deferred items. The §6.8 "either signal is sufficient" contract is only half-enforced for normal-path failures.

**Suggested fix**: Thread `errorMessage` from `preFinalizeMetadata` (already in scope) into the extraction call when `derivedRunResultStatus === 'failed'`. No new DB read required if a future loop result carries an `errorMessage` field.

---

## Hermes Tier 1 — deferred review follow-ups

Captured from the second-pass code review on branch
`claude/hermes-audit-tier-1-qzqlD` (2026-04-21). Not blocking merge of
the Tier 1 build; queued for Tier 2.

### H1 — Add `successfulCostCents` to the `/api/runs/:runId/cost` response

**Context.** The Tier 1 response has an intentional asymmetry: `totalCostCents`
reads from `cost_aggregates` (includes failed calls) while `llmCallCount`,
`totalTokensIn/Out`, and `callSiteBreakdown` read from `llm_requests_all`
with a success/partial filter (excludes failed calls). This is documented
but UI consumers will misinterpret it eventually (e.g. compute an implied
cost-per-call by dividing totalCostCents / llmCallCount and get a biased
number when failures contributed non-trivial ledger cost).

**Fix.** Add an explicit `successfulCostCents` field to `RunCostResponse`
sourced from the same success/partial filter as the other new fields.
Remove the mental arithmetic trap; keep `totalCostCents` for accounting
completeness.

**Scope.** `shared/types/runCost.ts`, `server/routes/llmUsage.ts`,
`client/src/components/run-cost/RunCostPanel.tsx`, the pure module + test
matrix. Small but touches the API contract so warrants its own ship.

### H2 — Rollup-vs-ledger breaker asymmetry (Slack / Whisper)

**Context.** After Tier 1 Phase C, the LLM path uses the direct-ledger
breaker (`assertWithinRunBudgetFromLedger`) and is strongly consistent
with committed ledger rows. The Slack and Whisper paths still use the
rollup-based breaker (`assertWithinRunBudget`) which reads
`cost_aggregates`, updated asynchronously by
`routerJobService.enqueueAggregateUpdate`. Those paths can under-count
momentarily under concurrency — fine for their much-lower call volume,
but a long-term inconsistency risk if Slack/Whisper become hot paths.

**Fix.** Decide per caller whether the ledger read is worth the extra
DB hit. If yes, introduce sibling ledger-based helpers for
non-LLM cost boundaries (currently only `llm_requests` carries the
ledger shape; Slack/Whisper costs live in `cost_aggregates` only).
May require a unified per-run cost ledger before Slack/Whisper can use
a ledger-style breaker.

### H3 — `runResultStatus='partial'` coupling to summary presence

**Context.** `computeRunResultStatus(finalStatus, hasError, hadUncertainty,
hasSummary)` in `agentExecutionServicePure.ts` currently demotes a `completed`
run to `partial` when `!hasSummary`. Summary generation is not guaranteed
deterministic (reporting skill can fail, LLM can return empty), so a
semantically-successful run with no summary gets the `partial` outcome
tag — which then suppresses the success-only memory promotion and lowers
retrieval-quality scoring in `workspaceMemoryService`.

**Fix.** Decide whether `!hasSummary` is a downgrade signal or an
orthogonal field. Options:
  - Add a separate `hasSummary` flag on `agent_runs` and keep
    `runResultStatus` purely about task outcome.
  - Change the `completed + !hasSummary` branch to return `success`
    with a `summaryMissing=true` side channel.
  - Leave as-is but monitor production: if `partial` rates spike on
    the happy path, revisit.

Monitor for now; revisit before Tier 2 memory promotion work.

## Live Agent Execution Log — deferred items

**Captured**: 2026-04-21
**Branch the items are deferred FROM**: `claude/build-agent-execution-spec-6p1nC` (Phase 1 merge-ready after five external-review passes; review logs under `tasks/review-logs/`)
**Spec**: `tasks/live-agent-execution-log-spec.md`

This is the single source of truth for everything the Live Agent Execution Log build has deferred. Any future session working on this surface should start here, not by re-reading the review logs or the spec §9.

### LAEL-P1-1 — Finish `llmRouter` `llm.requested`/`llm.completed` emission + `agent_run_llm_payloads` writer integration

**Scope.** Most operationally valuable remaining item — without this, the Live Log timeline shows no "doing" phase between `prompt.assembled` and `run.completed`.

**Files.** `server/services/llmRouter.ts` has a scaffold TODO near the `llmInflightRegistry.add()` site. `server/services/agentRunPayloadWriter.ts::buildPayloadRow` + `server/services/agentExecutionEventEmitter.ts::tryEmitAgentEvent` are ready.

**Work.**
- Thread the provisional `'started'` ledger-row id from the idempotency-check transaction up to the emit call site.
- Emit `llm.requested` (critical) before `providerAdapter.call()` — guard on `ctx.sourceType === 'agent_run' && ctx.runId`.
- Inside the terminal ledger-write transaction (success / failure / budget_blocked / etc.), call `buildPayloadRow({ systemPrompt, messages, toolDefinitions, response, toolPolicies, maxBytes })` and insert into `agent_run_llm_payloads`. Populate `run_id` from `ctx.runId` (denormalised FK added in migration 0192).
- Emit `llm.completed` (critical) in the same `finally` block that writes the terminal row.
- Never emit for pre-dispatch terminal states (`budget_blocked`, `rate_limited`, `provider_not_configured`) — the adapter was never called.

**Spec references.** §4.5, §5.3, §5.7.

**Hazard.** The `run_id`-populating path must stay inside the terminal tx so a rollback drops both the ledger row and the payload row together. The route-level double-check on the payload endpoint depends on `payload.runId === run.id`; null values break silently if the migration's denormalised FK is ever dropped.

### LAEL-P1-2 — Remaining P1 emission sites

All non-critical (graded-failure tier; drop + warn on transient DB failure, no retry).

- **`memory.retrieved`** at `server/services/workspaceMemoryService.ts::_hybridRetrieve` return boundary. Payload includes `queryText`, `retrievalMs`, top-N `topEntries: [{id, score, excerpt}]`, `totalRetrieved`. Link to `memory_entry` of `topEntries[0].id` when non-empty.
- **`memory.retrieved`** at `server/services/memoryBlockService.ts::getBlocksForInjection` return boundary. Same shape, link to `memory_block`.
- **`rule.evaluated`** at `server/services/middleware/decisionTimeGuidanceMiddleware.ts` — fires whether or not a rule matched. Payload `{ toolSlug, matchedRuleId?, decision, guidanceInjected }`. Link to `policy_rule` when matched.
- **`skill.invoked`** at `server/services/skillExecutor.ts::execute()` entry — carries `{ skillSlug, skillName, input, reviewed, actionId? }`.
- **`skill.completed`** at the same function's result-return (inside the existing try/finally). Payload `{ skillSlug, durationMs, status, resultSummary, actionId? }`.
- **`handoff.decided`** (critical) at the handoff site inside `agentExecutionService.ts` — payload `{ targetAgentId, reasonText, depth, parentRunId }`. Link to `agent` of the target.

**Spec references.** §5.3 taxonomy, §6.2 "Files to change" table.

### LAEL-P2 — Edit audit trail (Phase 2)

**Spec.** §8 Phase 2.

**Deliverables.**
- Migration `0194_agent_execution_log_edits.sql` with RLS + manifest entry.
- New table `agent_execution_log_edits` — see spec §5.8 schema.
- Optional `triggeringRunId` query param on the existing edit surfaces (memory edit, rule editor, skill edit, data-source edit) — each writes an audit row on save.
- Client surface: `EditedAfterBanner` component on `AgentRunLivePage` (shown for past runs only, queries `agent_execution_log_edits` by `(entity_type, entity_id)`). Linked-entity Edit CTAs pass `?triggeringRunId=`.

**Ship criterion.** Edits made via a log-link are auditable; past runs show a banner on events whose linked entity has been edited since.

### LAEL-P3 — Retention tiering (Phase 3)

**Spec.** §8 Phase 3.

**Deliverables.**
- Migration `0193_agent_execution_log_retention.sql` — creates `agent_execution_events_warm`, `agent_run_prompts_warm`, `agent_execution_events_archive` (Parquet BYTEA) tables + RLS + manifest entries. Adds `archive_restored_at timestamptz` to `agent_runs`.
- Jobs: `server/jobs/agentExecutionLogArchiveJob.ts` (rotation worker, uses `createWorker()`) + `agentExecutionLogArchiveJobPure.ts` (pure cutoff math, mirrors `llmLedgerArchiveJobPure.ts`).
- Queue registration in `server/services/queueService.ts` as `maintenance:agent-execution-log-archive`, 03:30 UTC daily (offset from the ledger archive's 03:45 slot to avoid write contention).
- Env vars already declared in `server/lib/env.ts`: `AGENT_EXECUTION_LOG_HOT_MONTHS` (6) / `_WARM_MONTHS` (12) / `_COLD_YEARS` (7) / `_ARCHIVE_BATCH_SIZE` (500) / `_RESTORE_GRACE_DAYS` (30).

**Ship criterion.** Nightly job moves rows between tiers; read endpoints transparently fall through hot → warm → cold on lookup (cold returns a job handle + retrieval ETA, same pattern as the ledger archive).

### LAEL-P3.1 — Cold archive restore (trigger + worker, deferred)

**Spec.** §8 Phase 3.1.

**Schema support lands in P3** (migration 0193 adds `archive_restored_at` column). **Trigger endpoint + worker deferred** until a real operator request for a cold-archived run lands.

**Deliverables when the ask arrives.**
- `POST /api/admin/agent-runs/:runId/restore-archive` (system-admin only). Returns `{ jobId, estimatedAvailableAtMs }`.
- pg-boss handler `maintenance:agent-execution-log-restore` — unpacks Parquet blob, inserts with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, stamps `agent_runs.archive_restored_at = now()`.
- SLA target: best-effort <60 s per run; no hard guarantee.

### LAEL-FUTURE-1 — Admin-visible surface for drop + gap metrics

**Not blocking.** Counters exist server-side (`getAgentExecutionLogMetrics()` — `criticalDropsTotal`, `nonCriticalDropsTotal`, `capDropsTotal`) and client-side (`getAgentRunLiveClientMetrics()` — `sequenceGapsTotal`, `sequenceCollisionsTotal`). Per-incident log lines are wired. Surfacing on a system-admin dashboard is a separate small spec — recommend a row on `/system/llm-pnl` or a new `/system/agent-exec-log-health` page.

**Trigger to ship.** First production incident where an operator needs to correlate "timeline stopped at event 9_867" with "cap was hit".

### LAEL-FUTURE-2 — Trigger-based FK enforcement on `agent_run_llm_payloads.run_id`

**Not blocking.** Route-level double-check (the `llm_requests.run_id` pre-check plus the denormalised `payload.runId` secondary check) covers the read path today. Write-time enforcement lands implicitly with LAEL-P1-1 (payload writer will populate `run_id` from `ctx.runId` inside the terminal tx).

**Trigger to ship.** Never, unless a bypass-the-writer path ever lands that would insert a payload row without a `run_id` when a run exists.

### LAEL-FUTURE-3 — `run.created` boundary in the event taxonomy

**Not blocking.** Currently `run.started` is always sequence 1 (awaited at creation) and `orchestrator.routing_decided` (when present) is sequence 2.

**Trigger to ship.** If pre-run validation or routing retries land — then split `run.created` (pre-validation / dispatch decision) from `run.started` (post-validation / loop entry) so the timeline captures intent vs. execution separately.

### LAEL-FUTURE-4 — Causal grouping for parallel writers

**Not blocking.** Current single-writer-per-run model makes `sequenceNumber` both a total and a causal order.

**Trigger to ship.** If parallel sub-agent writers or async tool branches land — then `sequenceNumber` becomes total-only, and a separate `parentSequenceNumber` field (or a logical-clock variant) is needed for causal reconstruction. Operator-facing UI would need to clarify the semantic.

### LAEL-FUTURE-5 — Deeper `prompt.assembled` layer attributions

**Not blocking but visible.** Current emission records top-level layer lengths only (`master`, `taskContext`); `orgAdditional`, `memoryBlocks`, `skillInstructions` are emitted as `0`. Validator accepts this (non-negative check only) but the zeroes are misleading for the spec's "click a layer to see its contribution" UX.

**Work.** Refactor `buildSystemPrompt` in `server/services/llmService.ts` to return per-layer offsets natively alongside the assembled string. Plumb through to the `prompt.assembled` payload + `agent_run_prompts.layer_attributions` write. Unlocks the `LayeredPromptViewer` spec's intended drilldown.

### LAEL-FUTURE-6 — Per-run payload-persistence kill-switch

**Not blocking.** Per-tool `payloadPersistencePolicy: 'args-never-persisted'` already covers the per-tool case.

**Trigger to ship.** When an ops or compliance team asks for run-level "do not persist any payload for this run" — e.g. a regulated workload where even redacted payload bodies are out of scope.

## Spec Review deferred items

### Deferred from chatgpt-spec-review — riley-observations-dev-spec (2026-04-23)

**Captured:** 2026-04-23
**Source log:** `tasks/review-logs/chatgpt-spec-review-riley-observations-2026-04-23T08-33-46Z.md`
**Spec:** `docs/riley-observations-dev-spec.md`
**PR:** #179 — https://github.com/michaelhazza/automation-v1/pull/179

Deferred items from the 3-round ChatGPT review + closing verdict. All items are **reconsider-per-trigger** — explicitly out of scope for v1 but with a named condition that would force revisiting. Pre-launch posture (no live consumers, no partner capability ingestion, no queue-prioritisation layer) keeps them out of v1; each item has its own re-evaluation trigger captured below.

- [ ] **Automation + Workflow versioning and marketplace-readiness.** Full lifecycle ownership for shared/partner/BYO capabilities — immutable execution versions pinned on runs, opt-in upgrade paths, cross-tenant isolation, partner-provided capability ingestion, marketplace distribution primitives. **Reconsider per trigger:** (a) external party needs to publish capabilities the platform consumes, OR (b) in-place upgrades to a shared Automation cause a customer-visible break — whichever surfaces first. Spec foundation is already forward-compatible: §5.10a composition constraints (depth=1, no recursive Workflow calls, no callback composition) are the ruleset a future multi-party graph will inherit from. No v1 migration or schema accommodation required beyond §5.4a + §5.10a. (§9b main entry.)
- [ ] **`automations.deterministic` flag — capability-contract extension.** Declares whether the Automation is a pure function of its inputs. Not added in v1 because no subsystem currently keys on it. **Reconsider per trigger:** when/if Automation-response caching or memoisation lands — at that point cached-result safety needs the author's declaration. (§9b sub-block.)
- [ ] **`automations.expected_duration_class` flag — capability-contract extension.** Declares typical latency band (e.g. `fast < 5s`, `normal < 60s`, `slow < 300s`). Not added in v1 because the dispatcher has a single timeout constant and no queue-prioritisation layer. **Reconsider per trigger:** when queue prioritisation / SLA routing lands. Related-but-distinct: **per-row `timeout_ms` override column** is already tracked as a separate deferral under §9b Workflow-composition Part 2 — the timeout override is a hard ceiling, `expected_duration_class` would be a scheduling hint. (§9b sub-block.)
- [ ] **`irreversible` as third `side_effects` enum value — capability-contract extension.** Would distinguish `mutating-but-reversible` (create-contact, which we can delete) from `mutating-and-irreversible` (send-email, which we cannot unsend). Deliberately NOT added to the v1 enum — §5.4a keeps `read_only | mutating | unknown` only. **Reconsider per trigger:** if the platform's auto-gate-bypass posture changes post-launch (i.e. if "Execute Mode skips review for `mutating`" ever becomes the default, we would need `irreversible` as the explicit "always review regardless of mode" class). Until then, `mutating` is sufficient. (§9b sub-block.)

### Implementation-time follow-ups for riley-observations

Captured from ChatGPT's closing verdict on PR #179 — actions that belong in the build phase, not the spec.

- [ ] **Thin execution test harness — contract-behaviour validation before full build-out.** ChatGPT's highest-leverage next-step recommendation after spec finalisation: define a thin execution test harness that validates capability-contract behaviour before the full Part 2 build lands. Specifically, the harness validates the runtime behaviour declared by **§5.4a (Automation capability contract — `side_effects` / `idempotent` gate-resolution defaults, engine-enforced non-idempotent retry guard, `overrideNonIdempotentGuard` opt-in, hard `maxAttempts ≤ 3` ceiling with dispatcher clamp semantics)** and **§5.10a (composition constraints — depth=1, no `invoke_workflow` step type, no callback composition, dispatcher one-step-one-webhook defence-in-depth)**. The harness should exercise: (a) every `side_effects` × `gateLevel` default-resolution branch, (b) the engine-enforced non-idempotent retry guard with and without `overrideNonIdempotentGuard`, (c) the `maxAttempts ≤ 3` clamp path including authored `maxAttempts > 3` values, (d) both §5.10a error surfaces (authoring-time `workflow_composition_invalid` validator rejection + dispatch-time `automation_composition_invalid` defence-in-depth rejection). Goal is to surface engine-drift-from-contract before the full Part 2 implementation bakes assumptions in. **Not a v1 blocker** but the recommended first build-phase deliverable against this spec.

### LAEL-RELATED — `External Call Safety Contract` abstraction (cross-feature, unscoped)

**Not a LAEL deliverable.** Extract the pattern from `llmRouter.ts` — `intent-record → external-side-effect → single-terminal-transition → ghost-arrival-detection → caller-owned-retry → observable-in-flight → best-effort-history` — into a reusable platform primitive so payments, webhook dispatch, integration adapters, and long-running agent tasks can all inherit it without reintroducing unsafe retry logic.

**Why it's filed here.** Called out post-in-flight-tracker merge + reinforced during LAEL reviews. Has no spec yet.

## PR Review deferred items

### PR #171 — claude-md-updates (2026-04-22)

- [ ] Add non-goals enforcement gate to spec-reviewer — valid improvement but requires spec-reviewer to reason about product strategy (not just structural spec quality); out of scope for this PR; revisit when spec-reviewer is next revised.

## Deferred from pr-reviewer review — Universal Brief

**Captured**: 2026-04-22
**Branch**: `claude/implement-universal-brief-qJzP8`
**Source log**: [tasks/review-logs/pr-review-log-universal-brief-2026-04-22T07-35-39Z.md](./review-logs/pr-review-log-universal-brief-2026-04-22T07-35-39Z.md)

- [ ] **B10 — maintenance jobs bypass the admin/org tx contract (architectural).** `server/jobs/ruleAutoDeprecateJob.ts`, `fastPathDecisionsPruneJob.ts`, and `fastPathRecalibrateJob.ts` read/write RLS-protected tables (`memory_blocks`, `fast_path_decisions`) from outside any `withAdminConnection` / `withOrgTx` block. Without `app.organisation_id` or `SET LOCAL ROLE admin_role`, the selects return zero rows per org and the jobs are silent no-ops. Fix: enumerate orgs inside `withAdminConnection({ source: 'rule-auto-deprecate' })` with `SET LOCAL ROLE admin_role`, then wrap each per-org iteration in `withOrgTx({ organisationId: org.id, source: '…' })`. Mirrors the `memoryDedupJob.ts` pattern. Not blocking end-user functionality (the feature still works), but the decay/pruning never runs until fixed.
- [ ] **S2 — add skill definition .md files for `ask_clarifying_questions` and `challenge_assumptions`.** Handlers are wired in `SKILL_HANDLERS` so runtime dispatch works, but the file-based definitions pattern (`server/skills/*.md` with frontmatter) expects them. Without the .md these capabilities won't surface in the config assistant or skill studio UIs. Reference: `architecture.md` §Skill System.
- [ ] **S3 — strengthen rule-conflict parser tests.** `ruleConflictDetectorServicePure.parseConflictReportPure` drops malformed items silently via `continue`; production could let users save conflicting rules if the LLM returns malformed conflict objects. Add tests for: (a) existingRuleId not in candidatePool → dropped; (b) invalid `kind` → dropped; (c) confidence out of [0,1] → dropped.
- [ ] **S4 — remove or re-label `cheap_answer` canned replies.** `briefSimpleReplyGeneratorPure` emits `source: 'canonical'` artefacts with hardcoded placeholder rows ("See revenue data"). Users see properly-sourced-looking results that are actually stubs. Either (a) add `'canned' | 'stub'` to `BriefResultSource` and re-label, or (b) remove the cheap_answer route from the tier-1 classifier until real data resolvers land. Option (b) is simpler.
- [ ] **S6 — add trajectory tests for Phase 4 orchestrator gates.** The clarify/challenge gates are wired via masterPrompt text only (migration 0196). No runtime test pins "clarifyingEnabled=false → no `ask_clarifying_questions` tool call" or "estimatedCostCents > 20 AND sparringEnabled → `challengeOutput` on ApprovalCard". Prompt-only wiring regresses easily; a fixture under `tests/trajectories/` would catch drift.
- [ ] **S8 — move conversation-message websocket emits to a post-commit boundary.** `briefConversationWriter.writeConversationMessage` emits websocket events inline after the insert. If the outer request tx rolls back after the insert but before response, clients see an "artefact appeared" event for a row that was never persisted. Options: defer emits until `res.finish`, or adopt a tx-outbox pattern.
- [ ] **N1 — validate `artefactId` UUID shape in `briefArtefactValidatorPure.validateBase`.** Currently `requireString` accepts `""`. Add a UUID regex.
- [ ] **N2 — add prominent comment at `getBriefArtefacts` noting the backstop is a no-op until Phase 6.4 resolvers land** (`briefArtefactBackstop.ts` sets `idScopeCheck` and `scopedTotals` to `undefined`).
- [ ] **N3 — make `conversations_unique_scope` index org-scoped.** Change to `(organisation_id, scope_type, scope_id)` so the uniqueness invariant also holds formally across orgs (UUID collision is improbable but the index semantically belongs org-scoped). Needs a new migration that drops + recreates the index.
- [ ] **N4 — document the `scopeType` ↔ parent-table mapping** on `conversations.scope_id` in the Drizzle schema so future readers know which scope maps to `subaccount_agents.id` vs `agents.id` vs `tasks.id` vs `agent_runs.id`.
- [ ] **N5 — inject clock into `ruleTeachabilityClassifierPure`.** Replace inline `new Date()` with a `now: Date` parameter to match the pure-module convention.
- [ ] **N6 — inject `artefactIdProvider: () => string` into `briefSimpleReplyGeneratorPure`.** Currently uses `crypto.randomUUID()` inline; injection makes tests deterministic.
- [ ] **N7 — paginate `GET /api/briefs/:briefId/artefacts`.** Currently pulls all artefacts and flattens client-side; a long-running Brief conversation could accumulate hundreds. Add `limit`/`cursor` query params before marketing demos.

## Deferred from dual-reviewer review — Universal Brief

**Captured**: 2026-04-22
**Branch**: `claude/implement-universal-brief-qJzP8`
**Source log**: [tasks/review-logs/dual-review-log-universal-brief-2026-04-22T08-02-50Z.md](./review-logs/dual-review-log-universal-brief-2026-04-22T08-02-50Z.md)

- [ ] **DR1 — add `POST /api/rules/draft-candidates` route to wire `ApprovalSuggestionPanel` to `ruleCandidateDrafter.draftCandidates`.** The client panel posts to `/api/rules/draft-candidates` with `{ artefactId, wasApproved }` but no route exists, so every click on “Yes, suggest a rule” 404s and the panel silently dismisses. Wiring requires non-trivial server logic: scan `conversation_messages.artefacts` JSONB for the `artefactId`, verify kind === 'approval', load the parent brief for `briefContext`, look up existing related rules, then call `draftCandidates(...)`. Non-blocking because the rest of the Universal Brief flow works; only the approval→rule teach-loop is dark. Defer to the same follow-up pass as S3 (rule-conflict parser tests). Pre-existing from commit 6af10f1 — not introduced by the pr-reviewer fix pass.
- [ ] **DR2 — re-invoke fast-path + Orchestrator on follow-up conversation messages (spec §7.11/§7.12).** `POST /api/conversations/:conversationId/messages` and `POST /api/briefs/:briefId/messages` currently only write the user turn into `conversation_messages` and return. Per spec §7.11 ("Re-invokes the fast path + Orchestrator if the message looks like a follow-up intent rather than a passive 'thanks'"), follow-up turns should run `classifyChatIntent` on the new text and — for `needs_orchestrator` / `needs_clarification` — re-enqueue `orchestratorFromTaskJob`. Without this, chat surfaces become one-way after the initial response: the user can send questions but the system never agent-runs on them. Architectural scope — needs design for non-Brief scopes (`task`, `agent_run`) that don't currently enqueue orchestration, idempotency for passive acks, and whether simple_reply/cheap_answer can produce new inline artefacts on follow-ups. Pre-existing from commit 6af10f1 — not introduced by the pr-reviewer fix pass.
- [ ] **DR3 — wire approve/reject actions on `BriefApprovalCard` artefacts.** `BriefDetailPage.tsx` renders `<ApprovalCard />` without `onApprove`/`onReject` — the buttons render but clicks are silent no-ops. No server-side dispatch route exists either (grep for `/api/briefs/.*/approve` returns nothing). Blocks the entire write path: high-risk actions can be proposed by the Orchestrator but never approved through the primary detail surface. Architectural — needs: (1) new server route(s) to accept an approval decision and dispatch via `actionRegistry` / enqueue an orchestrator run, (2) execution record linkage so `executionId` + `executionStatus` on the artefact update, (3) client handlers that call the new route and refresh state. Pre-existing from commit 6af10f1 — not introduced by the pr-reviewer fix pass.

## Deferred spec decisions — crm-query-planner

**Captured:** 2026-04-22
**Source log:** `tasks/review-logs/spec-review-log-crm-query-planner-1-20260422T023318Z.md`

- [ ] Finding #20 — §21.3 "Phased rollout per org" vs `staged_rollout: never_for_this_codebase_yet` framing — AUTO-DECIDED (accept clarifying sentence). Rationale: §21.3 describes per-org capability grants via the skill-permission system, not infrastructure-level traffic-shifted rollout. The framing assumption targets % traffic / feature flags / canary deploys; per-org permission grants are standard operational practice. Clarifying sentence added to §21.3 to pre-empt future confusion. Human to verify the distinction is still intentional at implementation time.

## Deferred testing — crm-query-planner

**Captured:** 2026-04-22
**Source:** P1 build audit (spec §5 / §20.2)

- [ ] **Author `server/services/crmQueryPlanner/__tests__/integration.test.ts`** — single RLS-isolation integration test per spec §20.2. Assert subaccount-A caller cannot see subaccount-B data via `POST /api/crm-query-planner/query` against a registry-matched intent. Use the existing `rls.context-propagation.test.ts` harness pattern. Deferred from P1 build because authoring it needs a local DB harness for verification. The planner's RLS is already structurally enforced (every canonical dispatch routes through `canonicalDataService.withPrincipalContext`), so the residual risk is low, but the spec carves this test out explicitly as a "hot-path cross-tenant correctness concern that can't be proven by pure tests alone." Pick this up before P1 ships to production.

## Deferred from spec-conformance review — crm-query-planner (2026-04-22)

**Captured:** 2026-04-22T09:17:12Z
**Source log:** `tasks/review-logs/spec-conformance-log-crm-query-planner-2026-04-22T09-17-12Z.md`
**Spec:** `tasks/builds/crm-query-planner/spec.md`

- [x] **REQ #40 — PlannerEvent `at` scalar type mismatch.** Closed 2026-04-22 in the same pr-review session: runtime now emits `Date.now()` (epoch ms); `PlannerEventEnvelope` in `plannerEvents.ts` is `at: number`, matching the shared contract at `shared/types/crmQueryPlanner.ts` §6.6.

- [x] **REQ #57 — `stage2_cache_miss` reason not discriminated.** Closed 2026-04-22: `planCache.get` returns a discriminated result (`{ hit: true, plan, entry } | { hit: false, reason: 'not_present' | 'expired' | 'principal_mismatch' }`); the service branches on `reason` when emitting `planner.stage2_cache_miss`. `planCachePure.test.ts` updated.

- [x] **REQ #68 — Canonical-precedence tie-breaker: missing hybrid-promotion case.** Closed 2026-04-22: `applyCanonicalPrecedence` now implements three cases (promote to canonical when no live-only filters; promote to hybrid with `hybridPattern: 'canonical_base_with_live_filter'` when exactly one live-only filter; stay live otherwise). Uses `isLiveOnlyField` from `liveExecutorPure.ts`. Tests extended in `validatePlanPure.test.ts`.

- [x] **REQ #99 — RLS wrapping not present at `runQuery` top.** Closed 2026-04-22: `runQuery` now wraps its pipeline body in `withPrincipalContext(toPrincipalContext(context), …)` when an outer `withOrgTx` context is active (HTTP auth middleware provides it). Programmatic callers without an outer org-tx skip the wrap via `getOrgTxContext()` guard rather than triggering the primitive's throw. PrincipalContext mapping: `'user' → 'user'`, `'agent' | 'system' → 'service'`.

- [x] **REQ #103 — `PlannerTrace` never built or embedded on `planner.result_emitted`.** Closed 2026-04-22: `runQueryPipeline` now threads a `PlannerTrace` accumulator (stage1 / stage2 / stage3 / validator / canonicalPromoted / executor / finalPlan / mutations / terminalOutcome / terminalErrorCode) and attaches a deep-frozen snapshot to every `planner.result_emitted` / `planner.error_emitted` payload via `freezeTrace()`.

- [x] **REQ #111 — Route-level capability check is hard-coded, not verified.** Closed 2026-04-22: `server/routes/crmQueryPlanner.ts` now calls `listAgentCapabilityMaps(organisationId, subaccountId)` and unions `capabilityMap.skills + capabilityMap.read_capabilities` across agents linked to the target subaccount. Missing `crm.query` → `403 { error: 'missing_permission', requires: 'crm.query' }`. The union is passed through as `ExecutorContext.callerCapabilities` so §12.1's skip-unknown-capability rule continues to apply downstream.

- [ ] **REQ #64 — Spec self-contradiction on `systemCallerPolicy` (ambiguous; spec fix, not code fix).**
  - Spec section: §10.1 says `'bypass_routing'`; §16.1 says `'strict'`
  - Gap: `llmRouter`'s valid enum is `'respect_routing' | 'bypass_routing'` — `'strict'` is not a valid value. Implementation correctly uses `'bypass_routing'` per §10.1. §16.1's `'strict'` appears to be a stale line.
  - Suggested approach: patch §16.1 of the spec to replace `'strict'` with `'bypass_routing'` (or clarify that §10.1 is canonical). Requires `spec-reviewer` or a manual spec edit pass; no code change.

## Deferred from dual-reviewer review — crm-query-planner (2026-04-22)

**Captured:** 2026-04-22T11:00:00Z
**Source log:** `tasks/review-logs/dual-review-log-crm-query-planner-2026-04-22T11-00-00Z.md`
**Spec:** `tasks/builds/crm-query-planner/spec.md`

- [ ] **Principal `teamIds` resolution is not wired into planner entry points (Codex iter-1 finding 3).** Both `server/routes/crmQueryPlanner.ts` and the `crm.query` handler in `server/services/skillExecutor.ts` pass `teamIds: []` into `ExecutorContext`. The PR introduces `withPrincipalContext` wrapping inside `runQuery`, which in turn sets `app.current_team_ids` to `''`. Any canonical row tagged `visibility_scope='shared_team'` will be invisible to planner queries — a behavioral regression for team-shared data if/when any ingestion path starts setting that scope. Default scope for canonical rows is `shared_subaccount`, which is visible regardless of team membership, so the immediate impact in production today is zero. When team-sharing semantics become active, the fix is a shared `resolveTeamIdsForPrincipal(userId, organisationId)` helper wired into auth middleware (populate `req.user.teamIds` once) and consumed by both entry points. Cross-cutting change — out of scope for this PR. Reject the proposed inline fix; route to backlog.

- [ ] **Hybrid executor's `applyLiveFilter` under-fetches for live-only fields not translated into provider params (Codex iter-1 finding 2).** `liveExecutorPure.translateToProviderQuery` only extracts `pipelineId` (opportunities) and `status` (conversations/tasks) into the GHL request; the other live-only fields (`city`, `country`, `calendarId`, `appointmentType`, `customFields`, `unreadCount`, `note`, `label`) are applied post-hoc via `matchesLiveFilter` against the provider's unfiltered top-50 rows. This means a hybrid query for "contacts in Austin" can silently drop matching rows beyond the provider's first page of 50. Iter-1 finding 1 is partially mitigated by the canonical-resolvable guard I added in this review, but the deeper issue — hybrid executor semantics when the live-only field can't be efficiently pushed down — remains. Options: (a) add per-(entity, field) pagination-aware fetch in `applyLiveFilter`; (b) restrict case (b) promotion to a whitelist of (entity, field) pairs the provider can natively filter; (c) document the v1 cap and surface it as a `truncated: true` signal. Decision needed before high-volume hybrid queries ship. Not fixing in this PR — surface-area is too broad and the safe behavior today (via the canonical-resolvable guard) is to keep drafts on `live` when the remaining filters aren't canonical-resolvable, so the most broken case is already neutralised.

## Deferred from chatgpt-pr-review — crm-query-planner (2026-04-22)

**Captured:** 2026-04-22T11:07:47Z
**Source log:** `tasks/review-logs/chatgpt-pr-review-crm-query-planner-2026-04-22T11-07-47Z.md`
**PR:** #177 — https://github.com/michaelhazza/automation-v1/pull/177
**Spec:** `tasks/builds/crm-query-planner/spec.md`

- [ ] **Hybrid: ID-scoped live fetch (chatgpt finding #1 — remainder).** Replace the current "fetch all live rows for the entity, then reduce in memory" flow inside `hybridExecutor.applyLiveFilter` with an ID-scoped call that passes `canonicalBase.rows[].id` into the provider query so the live fetch returns only rows matching the canonical base. This is the mid-term form of the scalability guard ChatGPT flagged as [Must fix]. Overlaps with the dual-reviewer deferred item above (Codex iter-1 finding 2) — both items converge on the same primitive: per-(entity, field) pagination-aware, ID-scoped live fetch. Treat as a single follow-up PR. The short-term partial mitigation (warn log on `hybrid.base_at_plan_limit`) shipped in this review; the full fix requires extending `ghlReadHelpers.listGhl*` contracts to accept an `idsIn` array, which is a cross-cutting adapter change and out of scope for PR #177.

- [ ] **Runtime read-only enforcement on `ExecutorContext` (chatgpt finding #2).** Current read-only guarantee for the planner is structural: a CI grep guard (`scripts/verify-crm-query-planner-read-only.sh`) plus import discipline (executors may only import `*ReadHelpers` / canonical-read paths). ChatGPT's recommendation — mark `ExecutorContext.readOnly = true` and have every adapter throw on write when that flag is set — requires every `ghlAdapter` / `canonicalDataService` write helper to honour the flag, which is a cross-cutting adapter primitive. Approach to evaluate: a single session-level guard (e.g. `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY` on the Drizzle tx inside `withPrincipalContext` when the caller is the planner) covers DB writes with one primitive; GHL-side writes are already blocked by import discipline. Defer to a separate PR that touches both ends.

- [ ] **Live executor retry on transient `rate_limited` (chatgpt finding #6).** Spec §13 and §14.3 explicitly document fail-fast behaviour for v1 live-call failures. ChatGPT's "minimal 1 retry on rate-limited + distinguish retryable vs terminal errors" is a valid hardening direction but changes a documented spec invariant. Before implementing: spec amendment (add a retry invariant to §13, define retry/backoff envelope, update §14.3 hybrid fail-fast to reflect), then implementation in `liveExecutor.ts`. Route through `spec-reviewer` before coding.

- [ ] **Planner metrics panel — Stage 1 vs Stage 3 hit rate + cache hit rate (chatgpt observation).** `/api/admin/llm-pnl/planner-metrics` currently surfaces Stage 3 totals only (total calls, escalation rate, avg cost, avg latency, total cost). The underlying data is already emitted via `plannerEvents.emit` (`planner.stage1_matched`, `planner.stage2_cache_hit`, `planner.stage2_cache_miss`, `planner.stage3_parse_started`) and forwarded to structured logs. Extend `systemPnlService.getPlannerMetrics` to compute `stage1HitRate`, `stage2HitRate`, `stage3Rate` from a log-aggregation source (requires a log-ingestion pipeline) OR add a lightweight in-process counter that flushes daily. Pure dashboard-surfacing work; no core planner change required. Defer until there's real traffic to justify the wiring.

## Deferred from chatgpt-pr-review — PR #174 (2026-04-22)

**Captured:** 2026-04-22T10-22-29Z
**Source log:** `tasks/review-logs/chatgpt-pr-review-create-spec-conformance-2026-04-22T10-22-29Z.md`

Strategic follow-ons surfaced by the ChatGPT PR review of the `spec-conformance` agent introduction. Out-of-scope for PR #174; captured for future consideration once the three-layer validation pattern has bedded in.

- [ ] **Spec coverage metrics** — surface % of spec requirements implemented, with a breakdown by category (files / exports / schema / contracts / behavior). Output of `spec-conformance` already enumerates every REQ and its verdict; an aggregator could roll these up across a slug's review logs to produce a coverage dashboard. Gate on: first production use where a reviewer asks "how much of the spec did this PR land?".
- [ ] **Drift detection over time** — periodic re-verification of merged features against their original specs to catch post-merge implementation drift (refactor silently changes behavior the spec named). Would require a durable mapping from spec → merged branch/PR plus a scheduled re-run. Gate on: first confirmed drift incident.
- [ ] **Automated plan validation (plan → spec mismatch detection)** — before a chunked implementation starts, verify that `tasks/builds/<slug>/plan.md`'s chunk decomposition actually covers every REQ in the spec. Would close the "plans are loosely mapped to specs" gap ChatGPT flagged. Lighter lift than drift detection — can reuse the REQ-extraction pass from `spec-conformance`. Gate on: next feature where `feature-coordinator` + `spec-conformance` are run end-to-end on a multi-chunk plan.

## Deferred from chatgpt-pr-review — Universal Brief (round 1)

**Captured:** 2026-04-22T11:13:14Z
**Source log:** `tasks/review-logs/chatgpt-pr-review-universal-brief-2026-04-22T11-13-14Z.md`
**PR:** #176 — https://github.com/michaelhazza/automation-v1/pull/176

- [x] ~~CGF1 — backend lifecycle write-time enforcement.~~ **Implemented in round 3** via `validateLifecycleWriteGuardPure` + `validateLifecycleChainForWrite`, integrated in `briefConversationWriter.ts`. Scope: the "a parent can only be superseded once" invariant (duplicate-tip class) is enforced at write time; orphan parents remain an eventual-consistency case the UI resolves. 7 new tests cover the pure function (existing sibling blocks, batch-internal duplicates, idempotent rewrites, no-parent artefacts, independent chains).
- [ ] **CGF4b — extract shared `ConversationPane` component** (hook already shipped as `useConversation` in this PR — see round 2 decisions). The remaining duplication is the visual shell (message list, input, send button) which differs only in placeholder text and header copy. Low priority — revisit when a third chat pane pattern emerges. Until then, both panes share the hook so the fetch/state/send behaviour stays consistent.
- [ ] **CGF6 — idempotency key for `saveRule`.** Current `saveRule` path can duplicate rules on request retries (unique conflict detector operates on semantic overlap, not request retry). Proposed: add `idempotencyKey?: string` to `RuleCaptureRequest`, derive default from `condition + action + scope + normalised_text`, dedupe at write layer. Needs design on: (a) precise key derivation, (b) relationship with `ruleConflictDetectorServicePure` — is a retry a "conflict"? a "no-op"? a new insert?, (c) whether to enforce at DB layer with a unique partial index. Surfaced by ChatGPT round 4 — defer as focused follow-up PR, out of scope for Universal Brief v1.

## Deferred from spec-reviewer review — riley-observations-dev-spec (2026-04-22)

**Captured:** 2026-04-22T21-45-51Z
**Source log:** `tasks/review-logs/spec-reviewer-log-riley-observations-dev-spec-2026-04-22T21-45-51Z.md`
**Spec:** `docs/riley-observations-dev-spec.md`

AUTO-DECIDED items from the spec-reviewer iteration — directional and ambiguous findings that the agent resolved conservatively in-spec or routed here for human review. The spec's mechanical fixes have been applied in-session; these are the architecture-level questions that remain.

- [ ] **F6 / §6.3 / §12.25 — `safety_mode` vs pre-existing `run_mode` collision.** The spec's Part 3 originally tried to ADD a `run_mode` column with values `('explore', 'execute')` to the renamed `workflow_runs` table. That table already has a `run_mode` column (from migration `0086_playbook_run_mode.sql`) with four execution-style values (`auto|supervised|background|bulk`). The agent resolved mechanically by introducing a NEW column `safety_mode` to avoid overloading — preserves the architect's ability to decide the final shape. **Human to confirm:** is the split `run_mode` (execution style) / `safety_mode` (Explore/Execute) correct, OR do we want to migrate the existing `run_mode` to hold the safety enum and record execution-style on a different column? Alternative: a composite `runConfig` JSONB. Default: keep the split.
- [ ] **F10 / §6.8 / §12.13 — Portal run-mode field unnamed.** Customer-initiated Workflow runs in the portal "use agency-configured defaults." The spec does not name which `subaccount_agents` column carries that default. Architect must either (a) identify an existing column, OR (b) add a new column (recommendation: `subaccount_agents.portal_default_safety_mode text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'explore'`) to migration `0205` and inventory it in §4.8. Non-negotiable before Part 3 migration lands.
- [ ] **F11 / §6.4 / §12.22 — `side_effects` runtime storage — DB column, JSONB field, or seed-only?** Skills are DB-backed at runtime via `system_skills.definition` JSONB; the markdown files in `server/skills/*.md` are authoring seed. Three options: (a) top-level `system_skills.side_effects boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true` column with backfill from markdown; (b) require `side_effects` inside the `definition` JSONB, validated by a parser gate; (c) keep frontmatter-only and regenerate `system_skills` from markdown at seed time. Agent recommendation: (a) — top-level column enables fast reads during gate resolution without JSONB unpacking per dispatch. Human to confirm before coding.
- [ ] **F15 / §5.4–§5.5 / §12.23 — `input_schema` / `output_schema` validator + format.** `processes.input_schema` and `output_schema` are plain `text` columns today with no canonical format. The spec's v1 validation is softened to best-effort (if parseable, validate; otherwise skip). Architect must pick: (a) validator library (ajv / zod / custom), (b) schema format (JSON Schema vs lighter), (c) whether `additionalProperties: false` is the default posture. Until resolved, `invoke_automation` input/output validation is non-authoritative.
- [ ] **F21 / §7.4 / §12.16 — Rule 3 "Check now" trigger mechanism OR Rule 3 removal.** Rule 3 in the heartbeat gate depends on a "Check now" button/API that does NOT exist in the current codebase. Two options: (a) add a new `subaccount_agents.check_now_requested_at timestamptz NULL` column + `POST /api/subaccount-agents/:id/check-now` route + admin UI button (extra scope for a "cheap observation fix"), OR (b) drop Rule 3 from v1 and ship the gate with 3 rules. Agent recommendation: (b). Human to confirm.
- [ ] **F22 / §7.6 / §12.17 — Definition of "meaningful" output for `last_meaningful_tick_at` update.** The spec resets `ticks_since_last_meaningful_run` when a run produces "meaningful" output but does not define "meaningful." Agent recommendation: `status='completed'` AND (at least one action proposed OR at least one memory block written). Architect confirms before coding, per §7.6's new prose.
- [ ] **Supervised-mode removal call-site audit (spec §6.8 + §12.14).** §6.8 decides the Supervised checkbox is removed; the spec-reviewer aligned §12.14 to treat this as an audit step rather than an open decision. Before Part 3 implementation, architect confirms every `runMode: 'supervised' | 'auto'` call site in `playbook_runs.run_mode` (which becomes `workflow_runs.run_mode`) is either migrated or deprecated cleanly. Not a decision, but a verification step that must happen.
