## Audit Summary

Full audit of routes, services, DB schema, client-side code, auth/security, and config.

### Critical Findings (Must Fix Before Testing)

| # | Category | Issue | Location | Severity |
|---|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **Routes** | ~145 routes across 25 files use manual try/catch instead of `asyncHandler` | `server/routes/*` | CRITICAL |
| 2 | **Org Scoping** | `skillService.getSkill()` and `getSkillBySlug()` don't filter by organisationId | `server/services/skillService.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 3 | **Org Scoping** | `fileService.downloadFile()` doesn't scope file lookup by org | `server/services/fileService.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 4 | **Org Scoping** | `taskService` activities query lacks organisationId filter | `server/services/taskService.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 5 | **Soft Delete** | `skillService` queries don't filter `isNull(deletedAt)` | `server/services/skillService.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 6 | **Schema** | `processes.organisationId` is nullable — should be `.notNull()` | `server/db/schema/processes.ts` | CRITICAL |
| 7 | **TypeScript** | `HeartbeatEditor.tsx` uses `clientWidth` on `DOMRect` (wrong API) | `client/src/components/HeartbeatEditor.tsx:75` | HIGH |
| 8 | **TypeScript** | `AdminAgentEditPage.tsx` passes wrong props to component | `client/src/pages/AdminAgentEditPage.tsx:1035` | HIGH |
| 9 | **Transactions** | `reviewService` updates actions + reviewItems without transaction | `server/services/reviewService.ts` | HIGH |
| 10 | **JSON Parse** | Unsafe `JSON.parse()` without try/catch in `executions.ts` route | `server/routes/executions.ts:54` | HIGH |
| 11 | **Hard Delete** | `taskService` hard-deletes deliverables instead of soft-delete | `server/services/taskService.ts` | HIGH |

### Important Findings (Should Fix)

| # | Category | Issue | Location | Severity |

| 12 | **Schema** | Missing `organisationId` indexes on agentTriggers, processConnectionMappings, processedResources, reviewItems | `server/db/schema/*` | MEDIUM |
| 13 | **Config** | `connectionTokenService` doesn't validate TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY on startup | `server/services/connectionTokenService.ts` | MEDIUM |
| 14 | **Client** | `OrgAdminGuard` in App.tsx has no role/permission check — just null check | `client/src/App.tsx:82-85` | MEDIUM |
| 15 | **Client** | No API request timeout configured on axios instance | `client/src/lib/api.ts` | MEDIUM |
| 16 | **Client** | 12+ API calls silently swallow errors with `.catch(() => {})` | `client/src/components/Layout.tsx` and pages | MEDIUM |
| 17 | **Error Format** | Inconsistent error throw formats across services (plain objects vs Error instances) | Multiple services | MEDIUM |
| 18 | **Race Condition** | Budget reservation in llmRouter lacks transaction protection | `server/services/llmRouter.ts` | MEDIUM |

### Security Findings (from auth/security audit)

| # | Category | Issue | Location | Severity |
|---|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| 19 | **Security** | Helmet CSP disabled — no Content-Security-Policy header | `server/index.ts:72-76` | HIGH |
| 20 | **Security** | CORS allows wildcard origins with credentials enabled | `server/index.ts:77-80` | HIGH |
| 21 | **Security** | In-memory rate limiting lost on restart; bypassed in multi-process | `server/routes/auth.ts:6-20` | HIGH |
| 22 | **Security** | Webhook auth optional — no HMAC validation if WEBHOOK_SECRET unset | `server/services/webhookService.ts:72-74` | HIGH |
| 23 | **Security** | System admin cross-org access via X-Organisation-Id has no audit trail | `server/middleware/auth.ts:42-48` | HIGH |

| 25 | **Security** | No rate limiting on password reset / forgot-password routes | `server/routes/auth.ts:72-85` | MEDIUM |
| 26 | **Security** | Error messages leak internal details to clients in production | `server/index.ts:149-153` | MEDIUM |
| 27 | **Security** | Missing security audit trail — no logging of auth/permission events | No centralized audit | MEDIUM |

### Noted (Lower Priority / Post-Testing)

- Route files exceeding 200-line limit: `subaccounts.ts` (758L), `permissionSets.ts` (587L), `llmUsage.ts` (524L), `portal.ts` (502L)
- Auth tokens stored in localStorage (XSS risk — migrate to httpOnly cookies later)
- No React ErrorBoundary component
- Silent promise rejections in `workspaceMemoryService.ts`
- Missing cascade delete rules on parent-child task/agent relationships
- Deprecated columns in agents schema (`sourceTemplateId`, `sourceTemplateVersion`)
- OAuth state JWT window too long (10 min, recommend 5 min)
- No refresh token rotation on OAuth integrations
- JWT session expiry at 24h with no forced logout on password change

## Fix Progress

- [x] Fix TypeScript compile errors
- [x] Convert manual try/catch routes to asyncHandler (25 files)
- [x] Fix missing org scoping in services
- [x] Fix missing soft-delete filters
- [x] Add missing DB indexes
- [x] Fix unsafe JSON.parse calls
- [x] Wrap multi-step DB operations in transactions
- [x] Convert hard-delete to soft-delete in taskService
- [x] Validate TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY on startup
- [x] Add API request timeout
- [x] Final build & type check (server + client clean)

### Migration Required

The following schema changes need a DB migration before testing:
- `skills` table: new `deleted_at` column (for soft-delete support)
- `task_deliverables` table: new `deleted_at` column (for soft-delete support)

Generate with: `npm run db:generate` then `npm run migrate`

## Hermes Tier 1 — Deferred Item (S1 from pr-reviewer)

**Captured**: 2026-04-21  
**Branch**: `claude/hermes-audit-tier-1-qzqlD`

### §6.8 errorMessage gap on normal-path failed runs

**File**: `server/services/agentExecutionService.ts` lines 1350-1368

When `finalStatus` is `'failed'` but the loop produces a non-empty `loopResult.summary` via the normal terminal path (not a thrown exception), `errorMessage: null` is passed to `extractRunInsights`. The §6.8 short-summary guard then falls back entirely to the `hasMeaningfulSummary >= 100` check. A failed run with a 50-char summary but no thrown exception gets its memory extraction skipped — even if `agent_runs.errorMessage` was set before the loop terminated.

**Why it's deferred**: Pre-existing limitation. Documented at lines 1355-1360 as known; acceptable per spec §11.4 deferred items. The §6.8 "either signal is sufficient" contract is only half-enforced for normal-path failures.

**Suggested fix**: Thread `errorMessage` from `preFinalizeMetadata` (already in scope) into the extraction call when `derivedRunResultStatus === 'failed'`. No new DB read required if a future loop result carries an `errorMessage` field.

## Hermes Tier 1 — deferred review follow-ups

Captured from the second-pass code review on branch
`claude/hermes-audit-tier-1-qzqlD` (2026-04-21). Not blocking merge of
the Tier 1 build; queued for Tier 2.

### H1 — Add `successfulCostCents` to the `/api/runs/:runId/cost` response

**Context.** The Tier 1 response has an intentional asymmetry: `totalCostCents`
reads from `cost_aggregates` (includes failed calls) while `llmCallCount`,
`totalTokensIn/Out`, and `callSiteBreakdown` read from `llm_requests_all`
with a success/partial filter (excludes failed calls). This is documented
but UI consumers will misinterpret it eventually (e.g. compute an implied
cost-per-call by dividing totalCostCents / llmCallCount and get a biased
number when failures contributed non-trivial ledger cost).

**Fix.** Add an explicit `successfulCostCents` field to `RunCostResponse`
sourced from the same success/partial filter as the other new fields.
Remove the mental arithmetic trap; keep `totalCostCents` for accounting
completeness.

**Scope.** `shared/types/runCost.ts`, `server/routes/llmUsage.ts`,
`client/src/components/run-cost/RunCostPanel.tsx`, the pure module + test
matrix. Small but touches the API contract so warrants its own ship.

### H2 — Rollup-vs-ledger breaker asymmetry (Slack / Whisper)

**Context.** After Tier 1 Phase C, the LLM path uses the direct-ledger
breaker (`assertWithinRunBudgetFromLedger`) and is strongly consistent
with committed ledger rows. The Slack and Whisper paths still use the
rollup-based breaker (`assertWithinRunBudget`) which reads
`cost_aggregates`, updated asynchronously by
`routerJobService.enqueueAggregateUpdate`. Those paths can under-count
momentarily under concurrency — fine for their much-lower call volume,
but a long-term inconsistency risk if Slack/Whisper become hot paths.

**Fix.** Decide per caller whether the ledger read is worth the extra
DB hit. If yes, introduce sibling ledger-based helpers for
non-LLM cost boundaries (currently only `llm_requests` carries the
ledger shape; Slack/Whisper costs live in `cost_aggregates` only).
May require a unified per-run cost ledger before Slack/Whisper can use
a ledger-style breaker.

### H3 — `runResultStatus='partial'` coupling to summary presence

**Context.** `computeRunResultStatus(finalStatus, hasError, hadUncertainty,
hasSummary)` in `agentExecutionServicePure.ts` currently demotes a `completed`
run to `partial` when `!hasSummary`. Summary generation is not guaranteed
deterministic (reporting skill can fail, LLM can return empty), so a
semantically-successful run with no summary gets the `partial` outcome
tag — which then suppresses the success-only memory promotion and lowers
retrieval-quality scoring in `workspaceMemoryService`.

**Fix.** Decide whether `!hasSummary` is a downgrade signal or an
orthogonal field. Options:
  - Add a separate `hasSummary` flag on `agent_runs` and keep
    `runResultStatus` purely about task outcome.
  - Change the `completed + !hasSummary` branch to return `success`
    with a `summaryMissing=true` side channel.
  - Leave as-is but monitor production: if `partial` rates spike on
    the happy path, revisit.

Monitor for now; revisit before Tier 2 memory promotion work.
