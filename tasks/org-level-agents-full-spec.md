# Automation OS — Org-Level Agents & Cross-Subaccount Intelligence
## Combined Development Specification v1.0

**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Brief type:** Product and architecture — not a line-level technical specification. Claude Code will derive implementation specifics from the codebase directly.
**Scope:** Five sequenced phases with explicit gate conditions between them.
**Primary design principle:** Generic infrastructure, configured behaviour. Every feature built in this spec must be usable by any future integration. GHL is the first implementation, not the defining one.

## Context and Purpose

Automation OS is a multi-tenant platform where organisations manage work across multiple subaccounts using AI agents. Subaccounts are a generic concept — they represent whatever the organisation needs: clients, projects, departments, properties, portfolios. The platform doesn't prescribe what a subaccount is.

Today, every agent run is scoped to a single subaccount. There is no mechanism for an agent to operate at the organisation level, monitor across subaccounts, detect cross-subaccount patterns, or take action at the portfolio level. This is a structural limitation that prevents the platform from functioning as a true operating system.

The first and largest target market is GoHighLevel (GHL) agencies managing 20-100+ client sub-accounts. These agencies have a structural visibility problem: every client account is a data silo, and there is no system — native to GHL or available as a third-party tool — that monitors the portfolio as a whole, detects problems proactively, or takes action without a human logging in and checking manually.

Market research confirms this gap is real, unoccupied, and currently costs agencies $1,000-2,350/month in fragmented partial solutions that do not solve the core problem. The five capabilities that matter and that nothing in the market provides are: cross-subaccount pattern detection, account health scoring and churn prediction, proactive push alerting, autonomous action (HITL-gated), and portfolio intelligence that improves over time.

This spec describes how to extend the platform to support org-level agent execution, ingest external platform data through a generic integration layer, and deliver cross-subaccount intelligence — all as generic platform capabilities that are configured per-organisation, not coded per-use-case.

## Core Architectural Principle

**The platform is generic. The configuration is the product.**

This means:

- Agents, skills, and the integration layer are written with no knowledge of which industry, which platform, or which use case they are serving. They operate on normalised data entities and respond to configuration injected at runtime.
- Everything specific to GHL agencies — which data to fetch, how to weight a health score, what threshold triggers an alert, which agents to load, which skills to enable — lives in the database as configuration, not in code.
- A configuration template is the unit of deployment. Loading a configuration template into an organisation provisions the correct agents, enables the correct skills on each agent, and connects the correct integration. The code does not change. Only the data does.

The practical test for every implementation decision: "If we replaced GHL with HubSpot tomorrow, would this code need to change?" If the answer is yes, the wrong thing has been made generic.

## Existing Infrastructure (What We're Building On)

A full codebase audit reveals significant foundation already in place. This spec builds on it rather than rebuilding.

### Already org-ready (least work required)

| Component | Current State |
|-----------|--------------|
| Policy rules | `subaccountId` is already nullable; org-wide rules already work |
| Org budget caps | `orgBudgets` table exists and is enforced independently |
| Processes | Already support `scope: 'organisation'` with nullable `subaccountId` |
| WebSocket | `emitOrgUpdate` function exists, just not wired to execution flow |
| Board config | Org-level config already exists (nullable `subaccountId` on `boardConfigs`) |
| Agent hierarchy | `agents.parentAgentId` exists for org-level hierarchy (no UI yet) |
| Budget context | `BudgetContext.subaccountId` is already optional; org/global caps apply without it |

### Integration layer foundation

| Component | Current State |
|-----------|--------------|
| Adapter pattern | `server/adapters/` with `IntegrationAdapter` interface, GHL + Stripe implementations |
| GHL adapter | `crm.createContact` implemented; `tag_contact` + `create_opportunity` declared but not built |
| OAuth token lifecycle | `integrationConnectionService` with advisory-lock refresh, AES-256-GCM encryption — production-ready |
| Integration connections | Per-subaccount stored credentials for `gmail`, `github`, `hubspot`, `slack`, `ghl`, `stripe`, `custom` |
| Process-to-connector binding | `processConnectionMappings` + `processes.requiredConnections` slot pattern in place |

### Template system foundation

| Component | Current State |
|-----------|--------------|
| System templates | `systemHierarchyTemplates` + `systemHierarchyTemplateSlots` + `systemTemplateService` |
| Org templates | `hierarchyTemplates` + `hierarchyTemplateSlots` + `hierarchyTemplateService` |
| Template versioning | `appliedTemplateId` + `appliedTemplateVersion` tracked on `subaccountAgents` |
| Template slots | Reference `systemAgentId` or `agentId`, carry full blueprint fields, self-referencing `parentSlotId` for tree structure |
| Paperclip import | System admin can import templates from Paperclip manifests |

### Hard-coupled to subaccount (requires migration)

| Subsystem | Blocker |
|-----------|---------|
| Agent runs | `subaccountId NOT NULL`, `subaccountAgentId NOT NULL` |
| Execution config | Budget, skills, instructions all on `subaccountAgents` join table |
| Heartbeat scheduling | Schedule keyed to `subaccountAgentId` |
| Memory | All entries scoped to single subaccount |
| Tasks | `subaccountId NOT NULL` |
| Skill execution | `SkillExecutionContext.subaccountId` required |
| Triggers | Schema requires subaccount + subaccount agent |
| Review queue / HITL | Review items and actions require subaccount |
| Connections | OAuth connections tied to subaccount |

## Phase Overview

```
Phase 1 — Org-Level Agent Execution (Foundation)
  The platform prerequisite. Makes agents runnable at the organisation
  level without a subaccount binding. Nothing in Phases 2-5 works
  without this. Discovered during architecture audit — not addressed
  in the original AIL brief.

Phase 2 — Integration Layer + GHL Connector
  The data foundation. Extends the existing adapter pattern into a full
  integration layer with canonical schema, data ingestion, webhook
  handling, and scheduled polling. Agents consume normalised entities,
  never raw API responses. Can overlap with Phase 1 since it is a
  different subsystem.

Phase 3 — Cross-Subaccount Intelligence + Portfolio Health Agent
  The core value. Combines generic cross-subaccount capabilities
  (subaccount tags, org memory, cohort query skills) with the Portfolio
  Health Agent and its intelligence skills (health scoring, anomaly
  detection, churn risk, reporting, HITL-gated intervention).

Phase 4 — Configuration Template System Extension
  The deployment mechanism. Extends the existing hierarchy template
  system to include connector references, skill enablement maps,
  and operational parameters. The GHL Agency Template is the first
  published template. Loading it provisions everything.

Phase 5 — Org-Level Workspace
  The organisation gets its own workspace for org-wide work that
  doesn't belong to any single subaccount. Board, tasks, scheduled
  tasks, triggers, connections — same capabilities as subaccount
  workspaces but scoped to the organisation. Independent of the
  intelligence layer; built based on demand.
