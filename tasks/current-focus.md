# Current Focus

Sprint-level pointer for the active session. Update when the current spec, branch, or sprint changes. If no spec is in flight, leave the fields below set to `none`.

The HTML comment block at the top is read by the Mission Control dashboard (`tools/mission-control/`). Keep prose in sync; prose is canonical if they disagree. Status enum: `PLANNING` | `BUILDING` | `REVIEWING` | `MERGE_READY` | `MERGED` | `NONE`.

Per-session progress goes in `tasks/builds/<slug>/progress.md`, not here. Historical merge log lives in git (`git log --merges main`) and in per-build handoff files under `tasks/builds/<slug>/handoff.md`.

**Just merged:** PR #300 — `skill-merge-consolidation-pass` (squash-commit `pending-squash`, 2026-05-14T04:18:03Z). Conditional LLM consolidation pass for the skill analyzer's merge pipeline (migration 0358). Fires only when `validateMergeOutput` emits `SCOPE_EXPANSION` / `SCOPE_EXPANSION_CRITICAL`. New closed enum `consolidationOutcome` (`not_triggered | succeeded | declined | failed`) with `failureReason='not_shortened'` routing non-shortening LLM outputs to `failed` (dual-reviewer ACCEPT). Three informational warning codes (`CONSOLIDATION_APPLIED | DECLINED | FAILED`). chatgpt-pr-review APPROVED after 2 rounds (F4 canonical-JSON deep-equality + regression test applied; 4 findings rejected with code-cited rationale; 1 deferred as `SKILL-MERGE-RATIONALE-1`). CI fix-loop: 1 iteration (migration 0358 down was non-idempotent — `DROP COLUMN` without `IF EXISTS` violated the codebase convention that `*.down.sql` files must survive being applied first by the forward-only migrate runner). KNOWLEDGE.md +3 entries (Stripped-field upstream; Canonicalise JSON before deep-equality; LLM-self-attestation is not the success signal). 9 forward-backlog items routed to tasks/todo.md as `SKILL-MERGE-*`.

**Prior merge:** PR #299 — `personal-assistant-v2-operator` (squash-commit `6cd7e158`, 2026-05-14T00:44:20Z). Personal Assistant V2 (Operator Mode): cross-owner delegation pattern, live file events via R2 + UPSERT-derived version, capability-map V2 axis (`owner_user_id`), three-state owner-lookup privacy projection enforced at both service and route layers with org-scoped fail-closed, atomic claim+emit pattern for cross-owner timeout events with stale-claim TTL retry, DB trigger to auto-bump substep status-transition timestamp. 7 rounds of chatgpt-pr-review (APPROVED on Round 7); 22 findings applied; 4 backlog items routed to tasks/todo.md (PA-V2-LIST-APPROVALS-V1-ARM, PA-V2-WATCHER-HOST-BRIDGE, PA-V2-OPERATOR-TEMPLATE-PROMOTION, PA-V2-EVENT-IDEMPOTENCY). Mid-Phase-3 main-sync renumbered 6 V2 migrations to 0351-0356 (after main's iee-browser-on-e2b PR #297 claimed 0346-0350), plus EA controller-style flip moved 0345 → 0357. CI auto-fix loop closed: 2 iterations (RLS-gate single-line CREATE POLICY + action-registry snapshot refresh; then PDF determinism standalone-date-literal normaliser fix).

**Prior merge:** PR #297 — `iee-browser-on-e2b` (squash-commit `8008abae`, 2026-05-14). IEE browser substrate redirect from DigitalOcean to e2b sandboxes: 3 new tables (session profiles, per-subaccount settings, warm sessions), dispatch seam in `_ieeShared.ts::ieeDispatchBrowser`, profile manager + warm pool service scaffolds (RUNTIME-DISABLED until SDK lands), DigitalOcean retirement + CI gate. chatgpt-pr-review APPROVED after 4 rounds (28 findings closed); 9 deferred items as IEE-DEF-1..9. Phase 3 handoff: `tasks/builds/iee-browser-on-e2b/handoff.md`.

**Paused build:** `support-desk-canonical` on `claude/support-ticket-structure-xMcy8`, PR [#277](https://github.com/michaelhazza/2025-automation/pull/277). Phase 2 (BUILD) complete; handoff at `tasks/builds/support-desk-canonical/handoff.md`. Recover by reverting `current-focus.md` to that build when ready to finalise PR #277.

**Prior merges:** see `git log --merges main` or the per-build handoffs under `tasks/builds/<slug>/handoff.md`. The historical merge log that previously lived in this file was trimmed 2026-05-13 (commit on branch `claude/cleanup-todo-knowledge-5ALbK`); content is preserved in git history.
