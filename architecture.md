## Route Conventions

### Use `asyncHandler` — never write manual try/catch in routes

Every route handler uses the `asyncHandler` wrapper from `server/lib/asyncHandler.ts`. Service-layer errors shaped as `{ statusCode, message, errorCode }` are caught automatically and returned as JSON.

```typescript
import { asyncHandler } from '../lib/asyncHandler.js';

router.get('/api/foo', authenticate, asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const data = await fooService.getData(req.orgId!);
  res.json(data);
}));
```

The manual try/catch pattern is **deprecated and must not be used**.

### One file per domain, max ~200 lines

Route files are focused on a single domain. If a file exceeds ~200 lines, split it.

| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Org agents | `agents.ts` |
| System agents | `systemAgents.ts` |
| Subaccount agent linking | `subaccountAgents.ts` |
| Agent runs | `agentRuns.ts` |
| Agent triggers | `agentTriggers.ts` |
| Skills (org) | `skills.ts` |
| Skills (system) | `systemSkills.ts` |
| Tasks & activities | `tasks.ts` |
| Board config | `boardConfig.ts` |
| Workspace memory | `workspaceMemory.ts` |
| GitHub webhook | `githubWebhook.ts` |
| Auth | `auth.ts` |
| Users | `users.ts` |
| Subaccounts | `subaccounts.ts` |
| Permission sets | `permissionSets.ts` |
| Processes | `processes.ts` |
| Executions | `executions.ts` |
| Integration connections | `integrationConnections.ts` |
| LLM usage | `llmUsage.ts` |

### Shared route helpers

- **`asyncHandler(fn)`** — `server/lib/asyncHandler.ts`. Wraps async handlers; catches service errors.
- **`resolveSubaccount(subaccountId, orgId)`** — `server/lib/resolveSubaccount.ts`. Validates subaccount exists and belongs to the org. Throws 404 if not. Use in every route that takes `:subaccountId`.
- **`authenticate`** — middleware that verifies JWT and populates `req.user` and `req.orgId`.

---

## Service Layer

- Services contain all business logic. Routes are thin wrappers.
- Services throw errors as `{ statusCode: number, message: string, errorCode?: string }` — `asyncHandler` catches these.
- One service per domain. Target max ~500 lines; `skillExecutor.ts` (65KB) is the exception.
- Never access `db` directly in a route — call a service.

---

## Auth & Permissions

### Middleware chain

```typescript
authenticate                          // always first — populates req.user, req.orgId
requireOrgPermission('key')           // check org-level permission
requireSubaccountPermission('key')    // check subaccount-level permission
requireSystemAdmin                    // system_admin only
```

### Request extensions

```typescript
req.user: { id, organisationId, role, email }  // from JWT
req.orgId: string                              // resolved org (may differ from user.organisationId for system_admin)
```

### Two-tier permission model

1. **Org-level**: `org_user_roles` → `permission_sets` → `permission_set_items` → `permissions`
2. **Subaccount-level**: `subaccount_user_assignments` → `permission_sets` → `permission_set_items` → `permissions`

Permission checks are cached per-request (`req._orgPermissionCache`). System_admin and org_admin bypass all checks.

### System admin org override

System admin can scope into any org via the `X-Organisation-Id` header. This is audit-logged to `audit_events`.

---

## Three-Tier Agent Model

This is the core data model. Understand it before touching anything agent-related.

```
System Agent (systemAgents table)
  — Platform IP; masterPrompt hidden from org admins
  — Default system skills attached
  — Heartbeat blueprint (schedule template)
        ↓ spawns / seeds
Org Agent (agents table)
  — Org-created OR system-managed (isSystemManaged: true)
  — System-managed agents inherit masterPrompt; only additionalPrompt is editable by org
  — Org-created agents own their full masterPrompt
  — Heartbeat config at org level
        ↓ linked per client
Subaccount Agent (subaccountAgents table)
  — Links an org agent to a specific subaccount
  — Can override heartbeat interval, execution limits, skills
  — Has parentSubaccountAgentId for subaccount-level hierarchy
```

### Key agent fields

| Field | Where | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `isSystemManaged` | agents | Cannot edit masterPrompt; only additionalPrompt |
| `systemAgentId` | agents | Living reference to the system agent template |
| `heartbeatEnabled` | all tiers | Whether this agent runs on schedule |
| `heartbeatIntervalHours` | all tiers | Run interval |
| `heartbeatOffsetMinutes` | all tiers | Minute-level offset for staggering runs (migration 0041) |
| `agentRole` | agents, subaccountAgents | Role in hierarchy (orchestrator, specialist, etc.) |
| `parentAgentId` | agents | Org-level hierarchy parent |
| `parentSubaccountAgentId` | subaccountAgents | Subaccount-level hierarchy parent |

---

## Task System

### Core schema

- `tasks` — Kanban cards. Key fields: `title`, `status`, `priority`, `assignedAgentId`, `isSubTask`, `parentTaskId`, `handoffSourceRunId`, `reviewRequired`
- `taskActivities` — Immutable activity log per task
- `taskDeliverables` — Deliverables produced by agents for a task

### Subtask & Reactive Orchestration

Tasks can be subtasks (`isSubTask: true`, `parentTaskId` set). When a subtask moves to `done`, `subtaskWakeupService` automatically triggers the orchestrator agent for that subaccount with completion context.

This turns the orchestrator from a timed polling model into an event-driven reactive model — the orchestrator wakes on meaningful state changes rather than on a fixed schedule.

---

## Heartbeat Scheduling

Agent scheduling uses **pg-boss** (PostgreSQL-based job queue), managed by `agentScheduleService`.

- Org agents and subaccount agents each have independent heartbeat config
- `heartbeatOffsetMinutes` allows minute-precision staggering (prevents thundering herd)
- `agentScheduleService` reads heartbeat config and enqueues runs into pg-boss
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate runs on retry (see below)

---

## Handoff & Sub-agent System

Agents can spawn sub-agents via the `spawn_sub_agents` skill.

- `handoffDepth` tracks nesting. Hard limit: `MAX_HANDOFF_DEPTH = 5` (see `server/config/limits.ts`)
- Sub-agents share parent token budget
- `agentRuns` records: `handoffDepth`, `parentRunId`, `isSubAgent`, `parentSpawnRunId`
- Sub-agent errors are bounded — parent run continues with error context
- Handoff jobs enqueued to `agent-handoff-run` queue in pg-boss

---

## Idempotency Keys

Agent runs accept an `idempotencyKey` (migration 0040). Prevents duplicate execution on client retry.

Format: `{runType}:{agentId}:{subaccountId}:{userId}:{taskId}:{timeWindow}`

System agents generate keys automatically. External callers should provide a deterministic key.

---

## Skill System

### File-based definitions

Skills are defined as Markdown files in `server/skills/*.md`. There are 29 built-in system skills:

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| Agent collaboration | `spawn_sub_agents`, `request_approval` |
| Workspace | `read_workspace`, `write_workspace`, `read_codebase` |
| Task management | `create_task`, `move_task`, `update_task`, `reassign_task`, `add_deliverable` |
| Testing | `run_tests`, `run_playwright_test`, `write_tests` |
| Code | `review_code`, `write_patch`, `search_codebase` |
| Integration | `web_search`, `fetch_url`, `send_email` |
| Admin | `triage_intake`, `draft_architecture_plan`, `draft_tech_spec`, `report_bug` |
| Execution | `run_command`, `trigger_process`, `capture_screenshot` |

### Skill executor & processor hooks

`skillExecutor.ts` implements a three-phase pipeline for every skill execution:

1. **`processInput`** — before permission gate: validate and transform input
2. **`processInputStep`** — after gate, before execute: prepare execution context
3. **`processOutputStep`** — after execute: transform and handle results

Processors can throw `TripWire` (from `server/lib/tripwire.ts`) to signal a retryable error — the job queue will retry rather than fail permanently.

### Skill scoping

| Scope | Table | Visibility |
|-------|-------|------------|
| System | `systemSkills` | Platform-only; not shown in org UI |
| Org | `skills` | Org admin can create/manage |
| Subaccount | inherited from org assignment | Subaccount-specific overrides |

---

## Review Gates & HITL

Tasks can set `reviewRequired: true`. When an agent acts on such a task, actions escalate to the review queue before executing.

- Review queue: `reviewItems` table
- Human approves or rejects via UI
- Integrates with `hitlService` for human-in-the-loop workflows
- Review decisions logged to `reviewAuditRecords`
- All review actions emit audit events

---

## GitHub App Integration

`githubWebhook.ts` is intentionally **unauthenticated** — GitHub cannot provide JWT tokens.

Security model: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification against `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Flow:
1. GitHub sends event (issue created, comment added, etc.)
2. Webhook verifies HMAC signature
3. Resolves subaccount from `installation_id` stored in `integrationConnections.configJson`
4. Creates a task on the subaccount board

---

## Board Config Hierarchy

```
Board Template (system_admin managed)
        ↓ initialises
Org Board Config (one per org, column array)
        ↓ "Push to All Clients" copies explicitly
Subaccount Board Config (per-client copy, independently editable)
```

Subaccount configs are **copies**, not live references. Changes to org config don't auto-propagate. Subaccount admins can override their board independently.

---

## Workspace Memory

- `workspaceMemories` table stores entities (type, content, tags, embedding)
- `workspaceMemoryService` handles CRUD and retrieval
- `memoryDecayJob` clears stale memories on a schedule
- Embeddings supported for semantic search across memories
- Used by orchestrator agent to accumulate cross-run context

---

## Policy Engine

`policyRules` table defines constraints on agent behaviour. `policyEngineService` evaluates rules during execution — can restrict actions, require escalation, or block execution. Evaluated before skill execution in the processor pipeline.

---

## Cost Tracking & Budgets

- `budgetReservations` — pre-allocate token budget before a run starts
- `costAggregates` — actual spend tracked after run completes
- `budgetService` — enforces per-run and per-org limits; throws if exceeded
- `llmPricing` table — model + provider pricing reference
- `llmRequests` table — every LLM call logged with tokens, cost, model

---

## Event-Driven Architecture

- **pg-boss** — job queue for all async work (handoffs, heartbeats, scheduled tasks)
- **WebSocket (Socket.IO)** — real-time updates to client. Rooms: subaccount tasks, agent runs
- **`useSocket` hook** — client subscribes to subaccount-scoped room for live updates
- **Audit events** — all significant actions logged to `auditEvents` with actor, action, resource
- **Correlation IDs** — `correlation.ts` middleware generates per-request IDs for log tracing

---

## Client Patterns

- **Lazy loading** — all page components use `lazy()` with `Suspense` fallback
- **Permissions-driven nav** — `Layout.tsx` loads `/api/my-permissions` and `/api/subaccounts/:id/my-permissions` to show/hide nav items
- **Real-time updates** — `useSocket` hook subscribes to WebSocket rooms for live board/run updates
- **API wrapper** — all HTTP calls go through `src/lib/api.ts`

---

## Key Patterns

- **Soft deletes** — most tables use `deletedAt`. Always filter with `isNull(table.deletedAt)`.
- **Org scoping** — all data queries filter by `organisationId`. This comes from `req.orgId` (not `req.user.organisationId` — they differ for system_admin).
- **Service error shape** — `{ statusCode: number, message: string, errorCode?: string }`. Never throw raw strings.
- **No direct db access in routes** — routes call services only.
- **No manual try/catch in routes** — use `asyncHandler`.
- **Lazy imports** — client uses `lazy()` for all page components.
- **resolveSubaccount** — call this before any route logic that takes `:subaccountId`.

---

## Migrations

41 migrations (0001–0041). Schema changes go through Drizzle migration files in `migrations/`. Never write raw SQL schema changes outside migrations.

Recent migrations:
- `0041` — heartbeat offset minutes (minute-precision scheduling)
- `0040` — agent run idempotency key
- `0039` — GitHub App schema
- `0037` — workspace memory + workflow schema
- `0036` — review queue + OAuth tables
