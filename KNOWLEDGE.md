# Project Knowledge Base

Append-only register of patterns, decisions, and gotchas discovered during development.
Read this at the start of every session. Never edit or remove existing entries — only append.

---

## How to Use

### When to write (proactively, not just on failure)
- You discover a non-obvious codebase pattern
- You make an architectural decision during implementation
- You find a gotcha that would trip up a future session
- You learn something about how a library/tool behaves in this project
- The user corrects you (always capture the correction)

### Entry format

```
### [YYYY-MM-DD] [Category] — [Short title]

[1-3 sentences. Be specific. Include file paths and function names where relevant.]
```

### Categories
- **Pattern** — how something works in this codebase
- **Decision** — why we chose X over Y
- **Gotcha** — non-obvious trap or edge case
- **Correction** — user corrected a wrong assumption
- **Convention** — team/project convention not documented elsewhere

## Entries

### 2026-04-04 Decision — Injected middleware messages use role: 'user' not role: 'system'

Anthropic's Messages API only supports `system` as the top-level parameter, not as mid-conversation messages. Context pressure warnings are injected as `role: 'user'` with a `[SYSTEM]` prefix. This is the correct pattern — `role: 'system'` inside the messages array would cause an API error.

### 2026-04-04 Pattern — Persist execution phase to agentRuns for observability

The agentic loop already computes `phase` ('planning' | 'execution' | 'synthesis') per iteration in `agentExecutionService.ts` (line ~940). Consider persisting this to the `agent_runs` row for debugging and post-mortem analysis. Deferred to next sprint — would require a schema change.

### 2026-04-05 Decision — Strategic research: build sequence after core testing

Completed competitive analysis (Automation OS vs Polsia.com) and broader strategic research (competitors, proactive autonomy, marketing skills, onboarding, ROI dashboards, voice AI). Key findings and build priorities documented in `tasks/compare-polsia.md`. Research session: https://claude.ai/chat/a1947df8-4546-4cbb-9d8e-65c542b5f40c

**Pre-testing build priorities (Bucket 1):**
1. Morning Briefing skill — read-only orchestrator evaluation cycle, validates agent quality with zero risk (~1 week)
2. Agency Blueprint Wizard — template-based workspace setup using existing `boardTemplates`/`agentTemplates`/`hierarchyTemplates` schemas (~1 week)
3. Baseline KPI capture during onboarding — enables ROI measurement later (2-3 days)

**Post-testing priorities (Bucket 2):** Proactive agent modes (Observer→Advisor→Operator→Autonomous), SEO agent skills, white-labeled ROI dashboards.

**Deferred (Bucket 3):** Voice AI (Vapi/Retell), paid ads skills, cold email, MCP protocol, agent marketplace.

Core platform testing must validate existing skills, three-tier agents, heartbeat scheduling, process execution, and HITL before adding proactive autonomy.

### 2026-04-13 Pattern — Capabilities registry structure for product + GTM documentation

`docs/capabilities.md` is the single source of truth for what the platform can do. Structure that works well across all audiences:

1. **Core Value Proposition** — 3-4 bullets anchoring the system before any detail
2. **Replaces / Consolidates** — three-column table (replaced / with / why it's better); highest leverage section for sales conversations
3. **Product Capabilities** — benefit-oriented, not config-oriented; one paragraph + 3-5 bullets max per section; deep detail stays in `architecture.md`
4. **Agency Capabilities** — Outcome / Trigger / Deliverable table per capability; add contrast ("not assembled manually") to differentiate from generic SaaS language; no skill references (that's triple representation)
5. **Skills Reference** — flat table with Type (LLM/Deterministic/Hybrid) and Gate (HITL/Universal/auto) columns; legend at top
6. **Integrations Reference** — tables by category (external services, engines, data sources, channels, MCP)

Update rule: update `capabilities.md` in the same commit as any feature or skill change. This is enforced via CLAUDE.md "Key files per domain" table. A CI guard script is a deferred follow-up task.

### 2026-04-13 Decision — GEO skills implemented as methodology skills, not intelligence skills

GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation) skills (`audit_geo`, `geo_citability`, `geo_crawlers`, `geo_schema`, `geo_platform_optimizer`, `geo_brand_authority`, `geo_llmstxt`, `geo_compare`) are registered as methodology skills in the action registry and use `executeMethodologySkill()` in the skill handler. This means the LLM fills in a structured template using the methodology instructions — there is no deterministic handler that does the analysis. This is the correct pattern because GEO analysis requires LLM reasoning over page content, not deterministic computation. The `geoAuditService.ts` stores results after the agent produces them; it does not compute scores itself.

### 2026-04-13 Pattern — GEO audit score storage uses JSONB for dimension breakdown

`geo_audits` table stores `dimension_scores` as JSONB array of `{dimension, score, weight, findings, recommendations}` and `platform_readiness` as JSONB array. This allows flexible per-dimension storage without needing separate tables for each score type. The `weights_snapshot` column captures the weights used at audit time so historical scores remain reproducible even if default weights change later.
