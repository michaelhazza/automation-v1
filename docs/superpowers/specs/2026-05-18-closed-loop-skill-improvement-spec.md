## 1. Summary

This spec defines Phase 1 of the closed-loop skill improvement system: a human-gated amendment proposal loop that turns scorecard failures into reviewed, typed behavioural overlays on inherited skills. When a scorecard verdict fails, a new `failure_post_mortem` pg-boss job synthesises a root-cause record, drafts a typed amendment, submits it for peer review (GPT-class via OpenAI), and — if the peer reviewer confirms it addresses the root cause — queues it in the existing morning review surface (Inbox / ReviewQueuePage) for one-click operator approval. Accepted amendments are composed deterministically on top of the inherited skill base without forking it. Rejected amendments become regression test cases. The loop is bounded (5 proposals/skill/week, 20 active/skill lifetime), schema-validated (5 typed amendment kinds with per-kind length ceilings), anti-recursive (evaluator surfaces are resolved through a separate code path that never consults `skill_amendments`), and gated by mandatory human approval.

The framing is: agents propose, humans approve. Nothing in this system activates behaviour autonomously.

---

## 2. Goals

- Introduce the `skill_amendments` table as the typed overlay primitive on top of inherited skills (system-tier and org-tier), without forking.
- Implement the `failure_post_mortem` pg-boss job: root-cause synthesis → schema-validated amendment draft → GPT-class peer review → queue insertion.
- Implement deterministic amendment composition in the skill resolver (`resolveSkillsForAgent`) with ordering, tie-breaking, fail-closed truncation, and `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` for historical replay.
- Deliver the morning queue amendment section (band below existing Needs Review tab content) with accept / edit-and-accept / reject flows, audit attribution, and regression-set tagging on every decision.
- Deliver the inline amendment stack on the SubaccountSkillsPage (expanded row for inherited skills) with retire and rollback-class retire actions.
- Deliver the inline composition panel on the RunTracePage (collapsed by default; shows snapshot and amendments-used tabs per §3.8 of dev brief; see §13.4 for the spec-level surface).
- Deliver the governance freeze switch (§4.9 of dev brief; see §7.8 + §13 in this spec) as a skill-detail admin surface.
- Implement evaluation harness additions: `skill_regression_cases` table, freshness-window auto-retirement (14 days), amendment effectiveness sidecar, proposer-quality telemetry.

---

## 3. Non-Goals

- Upward promotion of subaccount amendments to system tier (requires ring rollout — separate brief).
- Org-scoped amendments that fan out to all subaccounts in one authoring action.
- Autonomous amendment activation without human approval.
- Cross-subaccount pattern detection or learning.
- Prompt mutation / DSPy-style optimisation.
- Automatic semantic conflict reconciliation.
- Shadow-mode simulation of amendments against historical runs before surfacing.
- Amendment portability across skill clone, template, or export paths.
- `learned_failure_mode` memory entry type (deferred to Phase 2 — see §22).
- Auto-retirement of low-value amendments (Phase 2 escalation; §22).
- Surface B: cross-subaccount org-admin roll-up queue (deferred; §22).

---

## 4. Framing Assumptions

- Pre-production, no live external customers (`docs/spec-context.md`: `pre_production: yes`, `rollout_model: commit_and_revert`).
- Scorecard subsystem is operational: `scorecardJudgeJob`, immutable `scorecard_judgements` verdict rows, frozen rubric snapshots.
- Correction-pattern detector job (`correctionPatternDetectorJob.ts`) is operational and runs daily.
- Memory layer with typed entries and decay is operational.
- `getOrgScopedDb` / `withOrgTx` are the mandatory access pattern for all new tenant-scoped tables — no exemption.
- Skill resolution precedence (subaccount > org > system) is unchanged for forked skills; amendments apply only to the inherited-skill resolution path.
- No feature flag needed: data-gated — an empty `skill_amendments` table produces identical resolver output to today.
- The `failure_post_mortem` job runs only on `verdict = 'fail'` rows; `pass` and `inconclusive` verdicts do not trigger it.
- Custom subaccount skills (`skills` table rows where `subaccount_id` is set) are not amendable; they are edited directly.
- OpenAI API access is configured in the environment and exposed through `llmRouter`; GPT-class peer review (§5, §15.3) is a new `routeCall()` usage of an existing dependency, not a new SDK integration.

## 5. Existing Primitives

Every new primitive below is justified against the existing codebase. Where a primitive is being extended rather than invented, the extension is named.

| Proposing | Existing primitive | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Amendment overlay on skills | `skills` table (fork-on-customise) | New `skill_amendments` table — reuse is insufficient because forks sever inheritance; overlay is a structurally different primitive |
| Amendment composition at resolution | `resolveSkillsForAgent()` in `server/services/skillService.ts` | Extend — add amendment lookup + composition step after existing precedence resolution |
| Post-failure job | `correctionPatternDetectorJob.ts`, `scorecardJudgeJob.ts` | New `failure_post_mortem` job — distinct responsibility (synthesis + proposal) from detection (clustering) and judging |
| Regression set storage | `bench_runs` / `benchExecuteJob` | New `skill_regression_cases` table — bench_runs models model comparison; regression cases are held-out fail guards; structurally different |
| Amendment CRUD service | `skillService.ts` | New `skillAmendmentService.ts` barrel — amendment semantics (accept/reject/retire/rollback lifecycle) do not belong in the general skill service |
| Peer reviewer API call | `llmRouter.ts` | Route through `llmRouter.routeCall()` — peer review is governed by the same cost-tracking, retry, redaction, audit, and model-version contracts as every other LLM call (DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md §4). One-shot binary verdict shape is expressed via the `taskType` / `executionPhase` parameters on the router call, not by bypassing the router. |
| Morning queue UI section | `ReviewQueuePage.tsx`, `NewBriefModal.tsx` sibling pattern | Extend ReviewQueuePage with a new amendment-proposals band; new `AmendmentReviewDrawer.tsx` component under `client/src/components/review-queue/` per the established sibling convention |
| Inline amendment stack on skills page | `SubaccountSkillsPage.tsx` | Extend — new expanded-row panel for inherited skills; follows the existing expanded-row convention |
| Run trace composition panel | `RunTracePage.tsx`, `RunTraceEventRenderer.tsx` | Extend — new event card + collapsed composition detail section; follows the existing event-card pattern |
| Governance freeze | No existing freeze primitive | New `skill_amendment_freezes` table + admin UI section on skill detail page |

---

## 6. Governance Invariants

These invariants bind every implementation decision and are verified in §23. They are taken verbatim from the dev brief and are non-negotiable.

1. **Human approval mandatory.** No amendment activates without an explicit operator accept action. No automated activation, confidence threshold bypass, or silent activation path.
2. **Anti-recursion.** Amendments compose only into agent runtime skill bodies. Scorecard judge prompts, RCA proposer prompts, and peer-review prompts are resolved through a separate code path that never consults `skill_amendments`. Schema validation rejects any `proposed_remedy_body` whose declared target is an evaluator surface.
3. **Amendments are not memory.** Amendments are skill-scoped behaviour overlays; memory is per-entity recall. The two primitives are distinct; code, audit events, and UI copy must not conflate them.
4. **No hidden composition.** Every active amendment affecting runtime behaviour is discoverable from operator-visible surfaces. No invisible runtime-only overlays.
5. **Tenant isolation.** No amendment, RCA record, replay artefact, or proposer context may incorporate behavioural signals from another organisation or subaccount.
6. **Resolver determinism.** The composition step (`composeAmendmentsPure` — see §8.1) is a pure function of: system-skill snapshot, amendment snapshot set, resolver version, and explicit runtime inputs. No wall-clock time, mutable external services, or live model calls inside the composition step. The `resolveSkillsForAgent` entry-point wrapper persists the `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` row as a synchronous, awaited side effect AFTER composition returns (§8.1 step 5); this write is outside the pure composition boundary but on the critical path for resolution. Snapshot-write failure propagates as a resolution error.
7. **Fail-closed truncation.** If composition would exceed 12,000 chars total, the resolver returns the resolved-base body alone (system-tier or org-tier — whichever the precedence step selected) without any amendment overlays, and emits an alert. Silent truncation is forbidden.
8. **Retirement is non-destructive.** Retired amendment rows persist with full provenance; the regression linkage survives retirement.
9. **Operator trust posture.** UI copy uses "Proposed amendment from a failed run" not "Fix found"; "Apply" not "Approve"; "Why this was proposed" not "Why this is correct." Multi-paragraph AI-generated rationales are forbidden in the queue UI.

## 7. Data Model

Eight new tables. All tenant-scoped tables use `org_id NOT NULL` and route through `getOrgScopedDb`. All migrations land in sequence; migration numbers are assigned at implementation time (next after the current highest).

### 7.1 `skill_amendments`

Primary table. One row per amendment version.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | |
| system_skill_id | uuid \| null | FK `system_skills.id`. Set when amendment overlays a system-tier inherited skill. |
| org_skill_id | uuid \| null | FK `skills.id` where `org_id` IS NOT NULL AND `subaccount_id` IS NULL. Set when amendment overlays an org-tier skill. |
| org_id | uuid NOT NULL | Tenancy anchor. |
| subaccount_id | uuid \| null | Subaccount scope if set; org scope if null. Phase 1 proposer only writes subaccount-scoped rows. |
| kind | enum NOT NULL | `instruction_extension` \| `example` \| `guardrail` \| `context_fact` \| `exception` |
| body | text NOT NULL | Overlay content. Per-kind length ceiling enforced by CHECK constraint (see below). |
| source | enum NOT NULL | `operator_authored` \| `agent_proposed_from_failure` \| `agent_proposed_from_correction_cluster` (Phase 2 — see §22) \| `promoted_from_subaccount` (Phase 2 ring rollout — see §22) \| `imported_from_fork` \| `migrated_from_system_update` \| `copied_from_org_template` (reserved). The Phase 1 proposer writes only `agent_proposed_from_failure`. |
| status | enum NOT NULL | `draft` \| `pending_review` \| `accepted` \| `rejected` \| `retired` |
| version_number | integer NOT NULL default 1 | Per-amendment versioning. |
| proposer_run_id | uuid \| null | FK `agent_runs.id`. Run whose failure triggered this proposal. |
| scorecard_judgement_id | uuid \| null | FK `scorecard_judgements.id`. Verdict row that fired the post-mortem. |
| rca_record_id | uuid \| null | Provenance UUID (NOT a foreign key). Copied from `rca_json.record_id` at insert time and stored as a flat column to enable cross-table provenance queries without JSONB extraction. Stable identifier for the RCA record embedded in `rca_json`. |
| rca_json | jsonb \| null | Full RCA output: `failure_mode`, `contributing_factors[]`, `proposed_remedy_kind`, `proposed_remedy_body`, `confidence`. Stored inline to keep the provenance chain self-contained. |
| proposer_model_version | text \| null | Model family + version of the proposer (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`). |
| peer_reviewer_model_version | text \| null | Model family + version of the peer reviewer (e.g. `gpt-4o`). |
| peer_reviewer_verdict | boolean \| null | `true` = addresses root cause; `false` = does not. Null until peer review runs. |
| peer_reviewer_reasoning | text \| null | One-sentence reasoning from peer reviewer. |
| human_reviewer_user_id | uuid \| null | User who accepted / rejected. Null while pending. |
| human_reviewer_role | enum \| null | `subaccount_admin` \| `org_admin` |
| activated_at | timestamptz \| null | Accept timestamp. |
| retired_at | timestamptz \| null | Retirement timestamp. |
| retirement_reason | enum \| null | `graceful` \| `rollback` \| `stale` \| `superseded` \| `baseline_reset` |
| incident_severity | enum \| null | `sev1` \| `sev2`. Set only on rollback-class retirements. |
| superseded_by_amendment_id | uuid \| null | FK to replacement row in edit-as-new-version chains. |
| lineage_root_id | uuid \| null | Denormalised root of the supersession chain (for query efficiency). Set at insert; equals `id` for the root row. |
| originating_correction_cluster_id | uuid \| null | Reserved for Phase 2. FK target — the correction-cluster sidecar table — is deferred to Phase 2 (§22). Always NULL in Phase 1: the Phase 1 proposer is triggered by `scorecard_judgement_id` only, never by cluster ID. The Phase 2 migration that adds the cluster sidecar will also add this FK constraint. |
| reject_reason | enum \| null | `incorrect_root_cause` \| `overfit` \| `unsafe` \| `redundant` \| `low_confidence` \| `duplicate` \| `insufficient_context`. Set only on reject. |
| blast_radius_estimate | enum NOT NULL | `low` \| `medium` \| `high` |
| confidence | numeric(3,2) NOT NULL default 0.00 | Proposer self-reported 0.00–1.00. Advisory only. |
| occurrence_count | integer NOT NULL default 1 | Incremented on dedup match against a pending row. |
| suppressed_duplicate_count | integer NOT NULL default 0 | Incremented on dedup match against an active accepted row. |
| created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |
| updated_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |

**CHECK constraints:**
- `CHECK ((system_skill_id IS NOT NULL) <> (org_skill_id IS NOT NULL))` — exactly one FK set.
- Per-kind body length: `instruction_extension` ≤ 800, `example` ≤ 1500, `guardrail` ≤ 400, `context_fact` ≤ 300, `exception` ≤ 600. Enforced as a CHECK per kind.
- `context_fact` declarative-only: CHECK that rejects bodies containing imperative modals (`must`, `should`, `never`, `always`, `do`, `do not`) — enforced at application layer in `skillAmendmentService` before insert, not DB-level regex (too expensive at insert time; service validation is the primary gate).

**RLS:** `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Policy: `org_id = current_setting('app.organisation_id')::uuid`. All service-layer access via `getOrgScopedDb`.

**RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES entry:** `skill_amendments` — added in the same migration.

### 7.2 `skill_regression_cases`

Holds the regression set per skill. Held out from the proposer; re-run on every amendment acceptance.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | |
| org_id | uuid NOT NULL | Tenancy anchor. |
| subaccount_id | uuid NOT NULL | Regression cases are always subaccount-scoped. |
| system_skill_id | uuid \| null | Mirrors the amendment's FK. |
| org_skill_id | uuid \| null | Mirrors the amendment's FK. |
| scorecard_judgement_id | uuid NOT NULL | The original fail verdict row. |
| amendment_id | uuid \| null | The amendment proposed for this failure. Null if the proposal was dropped before reaching the queue (peer-review drop). |
| tag | enum NOT NULL | `fix_proposed` (amendment accepted) \| `fix_wrong` (amendment rejected) \| `unresolved` (pending or not yet reviewed) |
| created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |

**UNIQUE constraint:** `UNIQUE (scorecard_judgement_id) WHERE amendment_id IS NULL` (partial). Backs the idempotency claim in §18.1 for the §9.1 step 10 peer-review-drop path that writes a null-amendment regression case; a job retry after the drop runs will hit `23505` and no-op. Non-null `amendment_id` rows are not subject to this constraint — multiple regression cases can reference the same judgement under different amendments (e.g. a `fix_wrong` from rejected amendment A and a later `fix_proposed` from accepted amendment B for the same original failure).

**RLS:** `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Same org-scoped policy as `skill_amendments`. Entry in `RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES`.

### 7.3 `peer_reviewer_drops`

Shadow telemetry for peer-reviewer false-negative analysis.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | |
| org_id | uuid NOT NULL | |
| scorecard_judgement_id | uuid NOT NULL | |
| proposer_output_json | jsonb NOT NULL | Full RCA output from the proposer. |
| peer_reviewer_reasoning | text NOT NULL | One-sentence reasoning from the peer reviewer. |
| proposer_model_version | text NOT NULL | |
| peer_reviewer_model_version | text NOT NULL | |
| created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |

**UNIQUE constraint:** `UNIQUE (scorecard_judgement_id)` — one drop row per failed verdict. Backs the idempotency claim in §18.1: a `failure_post_mortem` retry after a peer-review drop already wrote this row will hit `23505` and treat it as no-op, preventing duplicate drop telemetry.

**RLS:** `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Org-scoped. Entry in `RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES`.

### 7.4 `skill_amendment_effectiveness`

Sidecar metrics per accepted amendment. Written by the regression replay job; updated on each replay.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | |
| amendment_id | uuid NOT NULL | FK `skill_amendments.id`. UNIQUE — one effectiveness row per amendment (supports `ON CONFLICT (amendment_id) DO UPDATE` from §9.4). |
| org_id | uuid NOT NULL | |
| regressions_prevented | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| subsequent_fail_rate_delta | numeric(5,4) \| null | Change in pass rate since activation. |
| operator_override_frequency | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| inactivity_decay_candidate | boolean NOT NULL default false | Set when no run composed this amendment in 30 days, or zero delta after 60 days. |
| last_replay_judge_version | text \| null | Last regression-replay (§9.2) judge model + version that produced verdicts feeding this row. |
| last_replay_resolver_version | text \| null | Last regression-replay resolver version composed for replays. |
| last_replay_model_version | text \| null | Last regression-replay agent model version replayed (`benchExecuteJob` produced these verdicts). |
| last_replay_at | timestamptz \| null | Timestamp of the last regression replay; updated on every replay run. |
| last_computed_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |

**UNIQUE constraint:** `UNIQUE (amendment_id)` — one sidecar row per amendment.

**RLS:** Org-scoped. Entry in `RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES`.

### 7.5 `amendment_proposer_metrics`

Per-proposer-model-version quality telemetry. Written on every accept / reject / edit / peer-review-drop.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | |
| proposer_model_version | text NOT NULL | |
| period_start | date NOT NULL | |
| proposal_count | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| accept_clean_count | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| accept_after_edit_count | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| reject_count | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| peer_review_drop_count | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| regression_failure_after_accept_count | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| rollback_count | integer NOT NULL default 0 | |
| created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |

**RLS:** No org-scoping — proposer quality metrics are system-wide. Not in `RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES`. Admin-only route guard.

### 7.6 `amendment_proposer_entropy`

Per-skill, per-month diversity metrics.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | |
| system_skill_id | uuid \| null | |
| org_skill_id | uuid \| null | |
| org_id | uuid NOT NULL | |
| period_month | date NOT NULL | First day of month. |
| template_repetition_rate | numeric(5,4) \| null | |
| lexical_diversity | numeric(5,4) \| null | |
| remedy_category_distribution | jsonb \| null | `{kind: count}` map. |
| created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |

**RLS:** Org-scoped. Entry in `RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES`.

### 7.7 `skill_amendment_run_snapshot`

Composition snapshot per run for historical replay correctness (§4.8 of dev brief).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | |
| run_id | uuid NOT NULL | FK `agent_runs.id`. |
| org_id | uuid NOT NULL | |
| system_skill_id | uuid \| null | |
| org_skill_id | uuid \| null | |
| resolver_version | text NOT NULL | Semver of the resolver code at run time. |
| amendment_version_set_hash | text NOT NULL | SHA-256 of the sorted amendment ID + version_number set. |
| composed_body | text NOT NULL | The actual resolved body the agent received. |
| included_amendment_ids | uuid[] NOT NULL | Amendment rows composed in. |
| excluded_amendment_ids | uuid[] NOT NULL | Retired or not-yet-accepted rows explicitly excluded. |
| composed_size_chars | integer NOT NULL | |
| truncated | boolean NOT NULL default false | True if fail-closed truncation fired. |
| created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |

**UNIQUE constraint:** `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT (run_id, system_skill_id, org_skill_id)` (PostgreSQL 15+). Backs the `ON CONFLICT (run_id, system_skill_id, org_skill_id) DO NOTHING` idempotency claim in §18.2 — at most one snapshot row per (run, skill) pair, regardless of which FK is set.

**RLS:** Org-scoped. Entry in `RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES`.

### 7.8 `skill_amendment_freezes`

Records active and historical freeze events for the governance freeze switch (§4.9 of dev brief). Note: `org_id` is `NOT NULL` on every row — true cross-org "global" freezes would violate the tenant-isolation invariant (§6.5) and are out of scope. Org-wide freezes use `scope = 'org'` with `scope_id = NULL` (the `org_id` column already pins the tenant).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | |
| org_id | uuid NOT NULL | |
| scope | enum NOT NULL | `skill` \| `subaccount` \| `org` |
| scope_id | uuid \| null | The skill/subaccount ID being frozen. Null for `scope = 'org'` (the `org_id` column already pins the tenant for org-wide freezes). Not null for `scope = 'skill'` or `scope = 'subaccount'`. |
| freeze_type | enum NOT NULL | `proposal_generation` \| `proposal_surfacing` \| `amendment_activation` \| `replay_execution` \| `review_required` |
| reason | text NOT NULL | Required before applying any freeze. |
| created_by_user_id | uuid \| null | Null when system-authored (e.g. `review_required` auto-freezes set by resolver on truncation or by proposer job on lifetime-cap hit; see §8.1 step 4 and §9.1 step 2). Required for operator-authored freezes. |
| thawed_at | timestamptz \| null | Null while active. |
| thawed_by_user_id | uuid \| null | |
| created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL default now() | |

**RLS:** Org-scoped. Entry in `RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES`.

**`review_required` semantics.** The `review_required` freeze type is the concrete primitive for the "review_required state" referenced elsewhere in this spec (§8.1 step 4, §9.1 step 2, §13.1, §17 Step 5). It is created system-authored — not by an operator — when one of two conditions fires:

1. Resolver fail-closed truncation (§8.1 step 4) — composition would exceed 12,000 chars; the resolver writes a `review_required` freeze with `scope = 'skill'`, `reason = 'composition_size_exceeded'`.
2. Lifetime amendment cap hit (§9.1 step 2) — 20 accepted amendments for this (org, subaccount, skill); the proposer job writes a `review_required` freeze with `scope = 'skill'`, `reason = 'lifetime_cap_reached'`.

A `review_required` freeze suppresses new proposals (same effect as `proposal_generation`), surfaces an orange warning badge in the morning queue band, and shows a warning banner on the skill detail page. Operators clear it by thawing the freeze (DELETE route §12).

**File:** `server/services/skillService.ts` — function `resolveSkillsForAgent()` (~line 115).

### 8.1 Amendment composition step

The amendment composition path has two layers:

- **`resolveSkillsForAgent(skillSlugs, ctx)` — impure wrapper** (in `server/services/skillService.ts`). Performs all I/O: precedence resolution, DB query for amendments, DB query for active freezes, snapshot write, freeze-row insert on truncation.
- **`composeAmendmentsPure({ baseRow, amendments, activeFreeze })` — pure function** (in `server/services/skillServicePure.ts`, new file). Takes the already-fetched data; returns `{ composedBody, includedAmendmentIds, excludedAmendmentIds, composedSizeChars, truncated, reviewRequiredReason }`. No DB, no clock, no network.

After the existing precedence resolution (subaccount > org > system picks the base skill row), the wrapper checks whether the resolved skill is inherited (i.e. `system_skill_id` or `org_skill_id` is set — not a custom subaccount skill). If inherited, it runs:

**Wrapper I/O steps (`resolveSkillsForAgent`):**

1. **Fetch amendments.** Query `skill_amendments` WHERE `(system_skill_id = $base OR org_skill_id = $base)` AND `org_id = $org` AND `(subaccount_id IS NULL OR subaccount_id = $subaccount)` AND `status = 'accepted'` — via `getOrgScopedDb`. The `subaccount_id IS NULL` branch matches org-scoped amendments; Phase 1's proposer only writes subaccount-scoped rows, but the resolver is org-scope-ready.
2. **Fetch active freeze.** Query `skill_amendment_freezes` for an active row (`thawed_at IS NULL`) scoped to this skill/subaccount/org with `freeze_type = 'amendment_activation'`. (Other freeze types — `proposal_generation`, `review_required` — are not consulted here; they're for the proposer, not the resolver.)
3. **Call pure step.** Invoke `composeAmendmentsPure({ baseRow, amendments, activeFreeze })`. The pure step applies composition ordering (§3.6 of dev brief — bucket order: org guardrails → org instruction_extensions → org examples → org context_facts → org exceptions → subaccount guardrails → subaccount instruction_extensions → subaccount examples → subaccount context_facts → subaccount exceptions; within a bucket: ascending `activated_at`, then ascending `id` as tiebreak), concatenates base text + amendment bodies, and returns the assembled body plus `truncated` and `reviewRequiredReason` outputs.
4. **Handle pure-step outputs:**
   - If `activeFreeze` was present: pure step returned the resolved-base body alone (without amendment overlays). Return that.
   - If `truncated === true` (total chars > 12,000): wrapper emits `composition.degraded` alert and inserts a `skill_amendment_freezes` row with `freeze_type = 'review_required'`, `scope = 'skill'`, `scope_id = <skill_id>`, `reason = 'composition_size_exceeded'`, `created_by_user_id = NULL` (system-authored). The pure step has already returned the resolved-base body alone; the wrapper does not retry composition. See §7.8 for `review_required` semantics.
5. **Snapshot write (synchronous, awaited, divergence-checked).** Wrapper writes a `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` row with the resolver version, amendment IDs used/excluded, composed body, and hash. The write is awaited before returning the composed body. The snapshot is outside the pure composition boundary (§6.6), but it is on the critical path for resolution: any snapshot-write failure propagates as a resolution error to the agent boot path, which refuses to start the run. The write uses an `ON CONFLICT (run_id, system_skill_id, org_skill_id) DO NOTHING ... RETURNING composed_body_hash, included_amendment_ids, excluded_amendment_ids, truncated` shape so the wrapper can detect the two outcomes: (a) `RETURNING` produced a row → insert won, fresh write; proceed. (b) `RETURNING` produced no rows → a prior snapshot already exists for this `(run_id, skill)` triple; wrapper issues a follow-up `SELECT` of the same columns and compares them against the values the pure step just produced. If hashes and amendment ID sets match, the conflict is a benign retry-after-success and the wrapper proceeds. If any field differs, the wrapper raises a typed `composition.divergence` resolution error (new entry in §18.7) which fails the resolution closed: the agent boot path refuses to start the run, a `composition.degraded` alert is emitted, and the divergent comparison (existing snapshot vs. recomputed values, plus the snapshot's `resolver_version`) is logged. This guarantees the §15.5 precedence rule ("snapshot wins for replay") has a row to win with on every executed run AND that the row matches what the pure step actually produced — historical replay, RCA grounding (§9.1 step 4), and run-trace composition (§13.4) all rely on snapshot fidelity, not just snapshot presence. The `ON CONFLICT (..) DO NOTHING` idempotency posture (§18.2) is preserved on the benign-retry path; the divergence path is the new fail-closed exit. Transient DB errors on the insert itself (connection blip, lock timeout, deadlock detection, non-conflict constraint violations) raise `composition.snapshot_write_failed` (§18.7) — retryable by the caller because the unique constraint + `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING + RETURNING` shape makes retry-after-success idempotent. A `composition.divergence` is never retryable: it signals the snapshot the agent already executed against differs from what we just recomputed, which is an integrity violation, not a transient blip.
6. **Return composed body.**

Custom subaccount skills (where the resolved row has `subaccount_id` set in the `skills` table) skip the amendment step entirely.

### 8.2 Anti-recursion code path

Scorecard judge prompts, RCA proposer prompts, and peer-review prompts are resolved via a separate function `resolveSkillForEvaluator(slug)` that reads from `system_skills` or `skills` directly, never calls `resolveSkillsForAgent`, and never consults `skill_amendments`. This structural separation is the §6 anti-recursion invariant enforcement.

### 8.3 Resolver versioning

The resolver version is a semver constant in `server/services/skillService.ts` (e.g. `RESOLVER_VERSION = '1.0.0'`). Increment the patch version on any composition-logic change; increment minor on new amendment kind support; increment major on ordering-invariant changes. The version string is written to `skill_amendment_run_snapshot.resolver_version` on every run.

### 8.4 Cache invalidation

Resolver output is cached per the 5-tuple `(org_id, COALESCE(system_skill_id, org_skill_id), subaccount_id, amendment_version_set_hash, active_freeze_id_or_null)`. The COALESCE handles inherited skills uniformly (either FK is set, never both per §7.1 CHECK). The freeze-id component invalidates the cache when an `amendment_activation` freeze is created or thawed (§8.1 step 2 reads this freeze state — the resolver result depends on it). Cache is in-process (Map keyed on the 5-tuple); not persisted. In-flight runs keep their resolved body for the run lifetime (resolution happens once at agent boot). Any status change on a `skill_amendments` row (accept, reject, retire, rollback) recomputes `amendment_version_set_hash` and produces a new cache key; the previous entry ages out naturally.

## 9. New Jobs

Registered in `server/services/queueService/maintenanceJobs/pgBossRegistrations.ts` alongside existing jobs.

### 9.1 `failure_post_mortem`

**Queue name:** `failure:post-mortem`
**TeamSize:** 2
**Trigger:** Subordinate pg-boss `send('failure:post-mortem', payload)` dispatched by `scorecardJudgeJob` inside the same transaction that writes the verdict row, on `verdict = 'fail'` only.
**Payload:** `{ scorecard_judgement_id, run_id, org_id, subaccount_id, skill_slug }`

**Job steps:**

1. **Freeze check.** Query `skill_amendment_freezes` for an active row with `freeze_type IN ('proposal_generation', 'review_required')` scoped to this skill, subaccount, or org. (Both types suppress proposal generation; see §7.8 — `review_required` is the system-authored variant set by resolver truncation or lifetime-cap hit, while `proposal_generation` is operator-authored.) If found, log `proposal_suppressed: freeze_active` (terminal event `amendment.dropped.freeze_active`, §18.4) and exit.
2. **Cap check.** Count `skill_amendments` WHERE `org_id`, `subaccount_id`, `system_skill_id|org_skill_id` match AND `status = 'accepted'`. If ≥ 20, insert a `skill_amendment_freezes` row with `freeze_type = 'review_required'`, `scope = 'skill'`, `scope_id = <skill_id>`, `reason = 'lifetime_cap_reached'`, `created_by_user_id = NULL` (system-authored); log and exit without drafting. See §7.8 for `review_required` semantics.
3. **Weekly cap check.** Count amendments created in the last 7 days for this (org, subaccount, skill). If ≥ 5, drop and log.
4. **Inherited-skill detection.** Read the `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` row for this run's skill (keyed on `run_id` from the job payload, scoped via `org_id`) — `system_skill_id` set means system-tier inherited, `org_skill_id` set means org-tier inherited, both null is impossible per the §7.1 CHECK constraint. If the snapshot row is missing, abort the job with terminal event `amendment.dropped.snapshot_missing` (a new entry in §18.4) and log a `composition.degraded` alert: the §8.1 step 5 write is synchronous, so a missing snapshot indicates a resolver- or DB-level integrity failure on that run, not best-effort loss — the failed run is not a valid RCA target without snapshot grounding. No fallback to `resolveSkillsForAgent` is permitted: the live resolver composes the current amendment set, which is not the state the failed run executed against, and using it would mis-ground the RCA. Abort with terminal event `amendment.dropped.custom_skill` if the snapshotted FK origin resolves to a custom subaccount skill (`subaccount_id` set in `skills`).
5. **Context assembly.** Gather the 6 inputs: failed run transcript, rubric snapshot from verdict row, failed check reasoning, entity record, recent operator corrections on this skill+subaccount, and the amendment stack that the failed run actually composed against — read from the §9.1 step 4 `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` row's `included_amendment_ids` (composed in) and `excluded_amendment_ids` (retired or not-yet-accepted), NOT from a fresh query against `skill_amendments`. The snapshot is the source of truth for what the run executed against (§15.5); a live re-query would surface amendments accepted after the run completed, retire-since-the-run rows, or rollback transitions, and would mis-ground the RCA. Look up the amendment row bodies by ID from the live `skill_amendments` table for content (Phase 1 does not version-pin individual amendment bodies — body edits go through `acceptAfterEdit` which creates a new row, so the snapshot's IDs continue to point at immutable body text), but the *set membership* comes from the snapshot. No cross-tenant data.
6. **RCA synthesis.** Call Claude Opus (frontier-class) with the assembled context. Schema-validate the output: `failure_mode` (string), `contributing_factors` (list ≤ 5, each references an input field), `proposed_remedy_kind` (one of 5 kinds or `no_remedy_proposed`), `proposed_remedy_body` (text, within kind ceiling), `confidence` (0.0–1.0). If `no_remedy_proposed`, exit cleanly.
7. **Anti-recursion check.** Reject any proposal whose `proposed_remedy_kind` or `proposed_remedy_body` targets evaluator surfaces (scorecard judge prompts, RCA proposer prompts, peer-review prompts). Log and exit if rejected.
8. **`context_fact` declarative-only check.** Reject bodies containing imperative modals (`must`, `should`, `never`, `always`, `do`, `do not`). Discard silently; log.
9. **Deduplication.** Hash `(skill_id, kind, normalised_body)`. Check against active accepted rows (suppress + increment `suppressed_duplicate_count`), pending rows (increment `occurrence_count`), and recently-rejected rows within 14-day freshness window (suppress unless ≥ 3 distinct failing runs in 7 days).
10. **Peer review.** Call GPT-class model via `llmRouter.routeCall()` with `taskType = 'peer_review'`, `executionPhase = 'evaluation'`, `sourceType = 'failure_post_mortem'`, and an idempotency key derived from `scorecard_judgement_id`. The router supplies cost tracking, retry policy (per §18.2), provider timeout, token-cost capture, and redaction. Input: proposed amendment + RCA context. Output: `{ addresses_root_cause: boolean, reasoning: string }`. If `false`: write to `peer_reviewer_drops`, write a `skill_regression_cases` row with `amendment_id = NULL`, `tag = 'unresolved'`, then exit. (The null-amendment regression row matches the §7.2 documented semantics: "Null if the proposal was dropped before reaching the queue (peer-review drop)" — it preserves the failed run as a regression candidate for future re-evaluation, even though no amendment was proposed.) If `true`: proceed. If `llmRouter` exhausts its retry budget (router-level timeout, all-providers-unavailable, sustained 5xx/429 across the configured attempt count, or open circuit-breaker), the job emits terminal event `amendment.dropped.peer_review_unavailable` (§18.4) and exits — un-peer-reviewed amendments must never reach `pending_review`; pg-boss redispatch (next retry window) will re-evaluate the router state.
11. **Write amendment row.** Insert into `skill_amendments` with `status = 'draft'`, then immediately transition to `status = 'pending_review'` via a second update (preserving the draft→pending_review state transition for audit). Populate all provenance columns (§7.1).
12. **Write regression case.** Insert into `skill_regression_cases` with `tag = 'unresolved'`, `amendment_id` set.

**Idempotency:** keyed on `scorecard_judgement_id` — unique constraint `skill_amendments(scorecard_judgement_id)` where `status != 'retired'` prevents duplicate proposals for the same verdict.

### 9.2 Regression Replay Job

**Queue name:** `amendment:regression-replay`
**TeamSize:** 1
**Trigger:** Dispatched by `skillAmendmentService.accept()` after writing the amendment row to `accepted`.
**Payload:** `{ amendment_id, org_id, subaccount_id, system_skill_id, org_skill_id }`

**Per-case expected verdict (derived from tag):**

- `fix_proposed` (amendment accepted) → expected verdict on replay = **pass**. The accepted amendment is supposed to have fixed the failure mode. A `pass → fail` flip is a regression — it means a newly-accepted amendment broke a previously-fixed case.
- `fix_wrong` (amendment rejected) → expected verdict on replay = **fail**. The rejected amendment was correctly judged not to address the root cause; the case is still expected to fail. Informational only; not a rollback trigger.
- `unresolved` (pending or not reviewed) → not replayed in Phase 1 (no amendment context).

Only `fix_proposed` cases drive rollback decisions. `fix_wrong` results are tracked but advisory.

**Job steps:**

1. Load `skill_regression_cases` for this skill+subaccount WHERE `tag IN ('fix_proposed', 'fix_wrong')`.
2. For each case, replay the original scorecard verdict using the `benchExecuteJob` replay primitives against the current composed skill body (includes the newly accepted amendment).
3. **Regression detection.** For each `fix_proposed` case whose replay verdict is `fail` (expected `pass` per the derivation above): the newly-accepted amendment regressed a previously-fixed case. Auto-retire the just-accepted amendment (`status → retired`, `retirement_reason = 'rollback'`, `incident_severity = 'sev2'`) in a new transaction, emit incident alert, increment `amendment_proposer_metrics.regression_failure_after_accept_count` and `rollback_count`. The `accepted → rejected` transition is forbidden (§18.6); rollback-class retirement is the canonical post-acceptance failure path (§20). `fix_wrong` cases that unexpectedly pass under the new composition are recorded but do NOT trigger rollback (their replay result is advisory only).
4. Write `skill_amendment_effectiveness` row with initial metrics (`ON CONFLICT (amendment_id) DO NOTHING` — only the first replay creates the row; subsequent replays update via §9.4).
5. Update `skill_amendment_effectiveness` for this `amendment_id`: set `last_replay_judge_version`, `last_replay_resolver_version`, `last_replay_model_version`, `last_replay_at = now()` (single most-recent-replay snapshot per §7.4 — Phase 1 does not retain per-replay-verdict history; if per-verdict provenance is needed later it can be added in Phase 2 as a separate table).

### 9.3 Freshness-window auto-retirement job

**Queue name:** `amendment:stale-retire`
**TeamSize:** 1
**Trigger:** Scheduled daily via pg-boss `schedule`. Runs in the existing maintenance job window.
**Payload:** `{}` (job enumerates orgs internally).

**Job steps:**

1. For each org, query `pending_review` amendments with `created_at < now() - interval '14 days'`.
2. Batch update to `status = 'retired'`, `retired_at = now()`, `retirement_reason = 'stale'`. State-based predicate: `WHERE status = 'pending_review' AND created_at < now() - interval '14 days'`.
3. Increment `amendment_proposer_metrics.reject_count` (tracking attrition).
4. Tag the associated `skill_regression_cases` row as `fix_wrong`.

Idempotency is implicit in the state-based predicate (already-retired rows are excluded). See §20 Failure Atomicity.

### 9.4 Effectiveness-metrics update job

**Queue name:** `amendment:effectiveness-update`
**TeamSize:** 1
**Trigger:** Scheduled daily via pg-boss `schedule`. Runs in the existing maintenance job window.
**Payload:** `{}` (job enumerates orgs and accepted amendments internally).

**Job steps:**

1. For each accepted amendment, compute `regressions_prevented`, `subsequent_fail_rate_delta`, `operator_override_frequency` from `scorecard_judgements` and `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` reads.
2. Set `inactivity_decay_candidate = true` when no run composed this amendment in 30 days, or zero delta after 60 days.
3. Upsert into `skill_amendment_effectiveness` keyed on `amendment_id` (`ON CONFLICT (amendment_id) DO UPDATE`).
4. Set `last_computed_at = now()`.

Idempotency: key-based on `amendment_id` (upsert). Multi-run safe within the daily window.

## 10. Modified Jobs

### 10.1 `scorecardJudgeJob`

**File:** `server/jobs/scorecardJudgeJob.ts`

**Change:** After writing the `scorecard_judgements` verdict row, if `verdict = 'fail'`, dispatch `boss.send('failure:post-mortem', payload)` inside the same transaction. The send is fire-and-forget within the transaction; if the transaction rolls back, the dispatch is also rolled back (pg-boss transactional send semantics). No change to the judge's existing scoring logic or output shape.

### 10.2 `correctionPatternDetectorJob`

**File:** `server/jobs/correctionPatternDetectorJob.ts`

**Change:** Add two new clustering dimensions alongside the existing embedding-similarity dimension:
- `failed_check_id` — the `quality_checks` slug from the `scorecard_judgements` verdict row linked to the correction.
- `entity_type` — the entity type referenced by the corrected run (customer, contact, deliverable, etc.).

Clusters that converge on a (`failed_check_id`, `entity_type`, embedding-similarity) triple are flagged as stronger amendment signal candidates. **In Phase 1**, the detector's existing output shape (memory-block writes via `memoryService`) is unchanged; the new clustering dimensions only influence which clusters get flagged. **Deferred to Phase 2 (§22):** a new `correction_clusters` sidecar table + a read path from `failure_post_mortem` keyed on `originating_correction_cluster_id`. Phase 1's proposer is triggered exclusively by `scorecard_judgement_id` (§9.1) and never reads cluster rows. The existing "suggest tightening pass marks" output is unchanged.

---

## 11. New Service

**File:** `server/services/skillAmendmentService.ts`

Thin barrel exporting the following functions. All functions route through `getOrgScopedDb`.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `listPendingAmendments(orgId, subaccountId)` | List `pending_review` amendments for a subaccount, priority-ordered per §4.4 of dev brief (priority order replicated in §13.1 of this spec). |
| `getAmendment(id, orgId)` | Fetch one amendment with provenance columns. |
| `accept(id, userId, role, orgId)` | Transition `pending_review` → `accepted`. Writes `activated_at`, `human_reviewer_user_id`, `human_reviewer_role`. Dispatches regression replay job. Emits audit event (`accept_clean`). |
| `acceptAfterEdit(id, editedBody, userId, role, orgId)` | Accept with body edit. Creates a new `skill_amendments` row (supersedes the original via `superseded_by_amendment_id`), sets `source = 'operator_authored'` on the new row. Emits audit event (`accept_after_edit`). |
| `reject(id, rejectReason, userId, role, orgId)` | Transition `pending_review` → `rejected`. Tags the `skill_regression_cases` row as `fix_wrong`. Emits audit event (`reject`). |
| `retire(id, retirementReason, orgId, incidentSeverity?)` | Transition `accepted` → `retired`. Sets `retired_at`, `retirement_reason`. If `rollback` class: sets `incident_severity`, emits incident alert. Invalidates resolver cache. |
| `validateAmendmentBody(kind, body)` | Schema validation: kind ceiling, `context_fact` declarative-only rule, anti-recursion target check. Returns `{ valid, errors[] }`. Used by the proposer job before insert and by the accept route for operator-authored amendments. |

---

## 12. Routes

All routes are authenticated (`authenticate` middleware) and org-scoped (`resolveOrg` middleware). Permission key: `manage_skill_amendments` (new key, added to the permissions registry).

| Method | Path | Handler | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendments` | List pending amendments | Subaccount admin + org admin. Priority-ordered. |
| GET | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendments/:id` | Get one amendment | |
| POST | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendments/:id/accept` | Accept amendment | Body: `{}`. Emits `accept_clean` audit event. |
| POST | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendments/:id/accept-after-edit` | Accept with body edit | Body: `{ body: string }`. Validates body before accepting. Emits `accept_after_edit`. |
| POST | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendments/:id/reject` | Reject amendment | Body: `{ rejectReason: RejectReasonEnum }`. Emits `reject`. |
| POST | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendments/:id/retire` | Retire amendment | Body: `{ retirementReason, incidentSeverity? }`. For accepted amendments. |
| GET | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skills/:skillId/amendments` | List all amendments for a skill | For the SubaccountSkillsPage expanded row. Includes accepted, retired, rejected. |
| GET | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendment-freezes` | List freeze events | For governance admin surface. |
| POST | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendment-freezes` | Create freeze | Body: `{ scope, scopeId?, freezeType, reason }`. Org admin only. |
| DELETE | `/api/subaccounts/:subaccountId/skill-amendment-freezes/:id` | Thaw freeze | Org admin only. **Soft-thaw semantics:** DELETE does NOT remove the row; it sets `thawed_at = now()` and `thawed_by_user_id = <caller>`. The row is retained for audit. Returns `204 No Content` on success, `409` if already thawed. |

**HTTP status mapping for state-based and unique-constraint conflicts:**
- Duplicate accept / reject / retire / acceptAfterEdit on the same amendment: `409 Conflict` from the state-based predicate (`UPDATE ... WHERE status='<expected>'` returning 0 rows; see §18.1). No `23505` is involved — amendment `id` is the primary key, so duplicate-id writes are impossible.
- Duplicate freeze for the same scope + type (active row exists): `409 Conflict` from `23505` on the unique partial index `(org_id, scope, scope_id, freeze_type) NULLS NOT DISTINCT WHERE thawed_at IS NULL` (`NULLS NOT DISTINCT` required for null `scope_id` on org-wide freezes — see §18.1).
- Duplicate failure_post_mortem dispatch for the same `scorecard_judgement_id` (active row exists): `23505` on the partial unique constraint `skill_amendments(scorecard_judgement_id) WHERE status != 'retired'`, caught in the job handler and treated as no-op (not surfaced as HTTP since this is a job, not a route).

---

## 13. Client Changes

Design source of truth: `prototypes/closed-loop-skill-improvement/` (4 screens, Round 5 CLEAN).

### 13.1 `ReviewQueuePage.tsx` — amendment proposals section

**File:** `client/src/pages/ReviewQueuePage.tsx`

Add a "Skill improvements" section band below the existing Needs Review tab content. Not a third tab — the tab pill (Briefs / Needs Review) is unchanged. The band:
- Renders when `listPendingAmendments()` returns ≥ 1 row.
- Priority-ordered per §4.4 of dev brief: incident-flagged rollback alerts, conflict banners, `review_required` warnings (rows whose skill has an active `skill_amendment_freezes` row of `freeze_type = 'review_required'`), high-blast-radius, high-occurrence, stale-soon, medium-blast, low-blast-grouped.
- Each row: skill name, kind tag, brief failure trigger (one sentence), blast-radius badge, occurrence badge (if > 1), stale-soon chip (if within 2 days of expiry). Click opens the drawer.

### 13.2 `AmendmentReviewDrawer.tsx` — new component

**File:** `client/src/components/review-queue/AmendmentReviewDrawer.tsx`

Sibling of `NewBriefModal.tsx`. Drawer (overlay) opened from the amendments section. Sections:
- Header: "Proposed amendment from a failed run" (per operator trust posture, §6.9). Kind tag. Skill name.
- What would change: before/after diff (composed body without amendment vs. with).
- Why this was proposed: failure trigger (run ID, scorecard check name, judge reasoning sentence). Collapsed by default — "Show why this was proposed" toggle.
- Accept / Edit & accept / Reject footer.
- Reject flow: 3 plain-English categorical buttons (per Round 5 CLEAN mockup at `prototypes/closed-loop-skill-improvement/s2-review-drawer.html`). Single confirm step. Mapping to `reject_reason` enum:
  - **"Not the right fix"** → `incorrect_root_cause` (canonical mapping; also the catch-all for operator-judged `overfit` / `low_confidence` cases — the operator-facing UI does not distinguish these subtypes).
  - **"Don't want this here"** → `redundant` (canonical mapping; also the catch-all for `duplicate` / `insufficient_context` cases).
  - **"Unsafe: don't suggest again"** → `unsafe`.
- The enum retains all 7 values for system-authored writes — dedup logic writes `duplicate` directly when an exact match is suppressed (§9.1 step 9); proposer schema validation writes `insufficient_context` when the RCA context bundle is incomplete.
- "Show technical detail" expander (collapsed by default): peer-review verdict, root-cause record, provenance chain (7 rows per §3.5 of dev brief).

### 13.3 `SubaccountSkillsPage.tsx` — amendment stack on skill rows

**File:** `client/src/pages/SubaccountSkillsPage.tsx`

For inherited skills (system-tier or org-tier), clicking the row expands an inline panel showing:
- Active amendments list (composition order numbered badges, kind tag, short body preview, Retire action).
- "Pause suggestions" toggle: creates a `skill_amendment_freezes` row with `freeze_type = 'proposal_generation'` for this skill.
- "Show advanced details" expander: stack-health mini-metrics (amendment_density, rollback_rate, edit_frequency), lineage graph for amended rows.

For custom subaccount skills, clicking expands a direct-edit panel (textarea + Save/Cancel). Note: "Custom skills are edited directly. Automatic improvement suggestions apply only to inherited skills."

### 13.4 `RunTracePage.tsx` / `RunTraceEventRenderer.tsx` — improvement event + composition panel

**File:** `client/src/pages/operate/RunTracePage.tsx` and `client/src/pages/operate/components/RunTraceEventRenderer.tsx`

- New event card: "Improvement proposed" (violet dot + badge). Compact card with skill name, kind tag, "Review" link to open the drawer.
- "Show composition detail" toggle at bottom of event stream (collapsed by default). Reveals two tabs:
  - **Snapshot tab:** resolver version, composed size in chars, amendment-version-set hash.
  - **Amendments used tab:** included amendments (ID, kind, activated_at) and excluded amendments (ID, retirement_reason).

---

## 14. Permissions and RLS Checklist

**RLS posture:** RLS enforces the organisation boundary; subaccount filtering is service-layer.

All seven org-scoped new tables (`skill_amendments`, `skill_regression_cases`, `peer_reviewer_drops`, `skill_amendment_effectiveness`, `amendment_proposer_entropy`, `skill_amendment_run_snapshot`, `skill_amendment_freezes`) use `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` with policy `org_id = current_setting('app.organisation_id')::uuid`. All service-layer access routes through `getOrgScopedDb`. Entries added to `server/config/rlsProtectedTables.ts` in the same migration that creates each table.

`amendment_proposer_metrics` is intentionally not org-scoped (system-wide quality signals). No RLS policy; admin-only route guard.

| Table | RLS policy | RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES entry | Route guard | Principal-scoped context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `skill_amendments` | org-scoped | yes | `authenticate` + `requirePermission('manage_skill_amendments')` | yes — resolver reads via `getOrgScopedDb` |
| `skill_regression_cases` | org-scoped | yes | admin-read only (not directly exposed to operators) | no — internal to replay job |
| `peer_reviewer_drops` | org-scoped | yes | admin-read only | no |
| `skill_amendment_effectiveness` | org-scoped | yes | readable via skill amendments list route | no |
| `amendment_proposer_metrics` | none (system-wide) | no | system-admin route only | no |
| `amendment_proposer_entropy` | org-scoped | yes | readable via admin dashboard | no |
| `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` | org-scoped | yes | readable via run trace route | no |
| `skill_amendment_freezes` | org-scoped | yes | `requirePermission('manage_skill_amendments')` + org-admin for write | no |

**New permission key:** `manage_skill_amendments` — added to `server/lib/permissions.ts` and `ALL_PERMISSIONS`. Granted to: `subaccount_admin`, `org_admin`.

## 15. Contracts

### 15.1 `failure_post_mortem` job payload

```json
{
  "scorecard_judgement_id": "uuid",
  "run_id": "uuid",
  "org_id": "uuid",
  "subaccount_id": "uuid",
  "skill_slug": "string"
}
```

Producer: `scorecardJudgeJob`. Consumer: `failure_post_mortem` job handler.

### 15.2 RCA output schema (proposer output)

```json
{
  "record_id": "uuid — generated by the proposer; copied to skill_amendments.rca_record_id",
  "failure_mode": "string — short categorical tag",
  "contributing_factors": ["string", "string"],
  "proposed_remedy_kind": "instruction_extension | example | guardrail | context_fact | exception | no_remedy_proposed",
  "proposed_remedy_body": "string — within kind length ceiling",
  "confidence": 0.87
}
```

Producer: Claude Opus inside `failure_post_mortem`. Consumer: schema validator in `skillAmendmentService.validateAmendmentBody`, then stored in `skill_amendments.rca_json`. The `record_id` is also copied to `skill_amendments.rca_record_id` (flat provenance column, not an FK; see §7.1).

Nullability: `proposed_remedy_body` is absent when `proposed_remedy_kind = 'no_remedy_proposed'`. `contributing_factors` is a list of 1–5 strings; each string must reference a field that exists in the job's 6-input context bundle.

### 15.3 Peer reviewer request / response

Routed through `llmRouter.routeCall()` (see §5, §9.1 step 10, §16). The job does not call the OpenAI SDK directly; `llmRouter` selects the GPT-class provider, applies cost tracking, retry, timeout, redaction, and audit per DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md §4.

**Router call parameters:**
```
{
  taskType: 'peer_review',
  executionPhase: 'evaluation',
  sourceType: 'failure_post_mortem',
  modelFamily: 'gpt',                 // GPT-class
  idempotencyKey: <scorecard_judgement_id>,

### 15.5 Source-of-truth precedence

When an amendment row and a `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` row disagree (e.g. amendment was retired after the run): **snapshot wins for replay purposes** (the agent received the composed body in the snapshot; that is historical truth). Live tables win for current operator views. Precedence: snapshot > live `skill_amendments` for audit/replay queries; live `skill_amendments` > snapshot for current queue/skill-detail views.

## 16. Execution Model

| Operation | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Scorecard failure detection | Inline (within `scorecardJudgeJob`) | Verdict write + subordinate dispatch in same DB transaction |
| `failure_post_mortem` | Queued async (pg-boss `failure:post-mortem`) | teamSize 2; retryable; decoupled from judge latency |
| Peer review (GPT-class via `llmRouter`) | Inline within `failure_post_mortem` | `llmRouter.routeCall()` with `taskType = 'peer_review'`; router supplies cost, retry, timeout, redaction, and audit |
| Amendment row insert | Inline within `failure_post_mortem` | After peer review passes |
| Amendment composition at resolution | Inline (within `resolveSkillsForAgent`, calling `composeAmendmentsPure`) | Pure composition step; result cached per `(skill, subaccount, amendment_version_set_hash)` |
| Snapshot write | Inline synchronous within `resolveSkillsForAgent` wrapper (after composition returns, before returning the composed body) | Awaited insert with divergence check: `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING ... RETURNING`, fall-back `SELECT` and compare on `RETURNING`-empty (§8.1 step 5). Two typed failure modes (§18.7): `composition.snapshot_write_failed` (transient, retryable) and `composition.divergence` (non-retryable, agent boot path refuses the run). Outside the pure composition boundary per §6.6, but on the critical path for resolution. |
| Regression replay | Queued async (pg-boss `amendment:regression-replay`) | Dispatched by `accept()` after writing `accepted` status |
| Effectiveness metrics update | Queued async (pg-boss, periodic) | Scheduled daily; not on the critical accept path |
| Freshness-window auto-retirement (14 days) | Scheduled (existing maintenance job window) | New pg-boss scheduled job `amendment:stale-retire` |
| Accept / reject / retire | Inline synchronous HTTP (route handler → service) | Returns immediately; regression replay is async |

No cached prompt partitions are introduced. No LLM calls inside the resolver.

## 17. Phase Sequencing

Six steps in dependency order. No backward references.

### Step 1 — Schema + resolver (no UI)

- Migrations: `skill_amendments`, `skill_regression_cases`, `peer_reviewer_drops`, `skill_amendment_effectiveness`, `amendment_proposer_metrics`, `amendment_proposer_entropy`, `skill_amendment_run_snapshot`, `skill_amendment_freezes` — seven org-scoped tables with RLS + `RLS_PROTECTED_TABLES` entries (all except `amendment_proposer_metrics`, which is intentionally system-wide per §7.5 / §14 with an admin-only route guard and no manifest entry).
- Resolver extension in `resolveSkillsForAgent`: amendment composition step (§8.1), anti-recursion code path (§8.2), resolver versioning (§8.3), cache invalidation (§8.4).
- `RESOLVER_VERSION = '1.0.0'` constant.
- `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` writes on every run from this step forward.
- No UI, no proposer job yet. An empty `skill_amendments` table produces identical agent output to today.

**Dependencies:** None.

### Step 2 — `failure_post_mortem` job (RCA only, no amendment drafts yet)

- Register `failure:post-mortem` in `pgBossRegistrations.ts`.
- Implement job handler: §9.1 steps 1–6 (freeze check, weekly + lifetime caps, inherited-skill detection, context assembly, RCA synthesis). Do NOT yet implement steps 7+ (anti-recursion, declarative-only, dedup, peer review, amendment insert, regression case insert) — those land in Step 3.
- `scorecardJudgeJob` modification: dispatch `failure:post-mortem` on `verdict = 'fail'`.
- Inspect RCA outputs in job logs only. No `skill_amendments` rows are written in Step 2 — row insertion is gated on schema validation + peer review (Step 3, §9.1 step 11).
- Sanity gate: inspect real RCA outputs from at least 10 internal fail verdicts before wiring amendment proposals in Step 3.

**Dependencies:** Step 1 (tables, resolver).

### Step 3 — Amendment proposer + peer review

- Add §9.1 steps 7–12 of the `failure_post_mortem` job: anti-recursion check, `context_fact` declarative-only check, deduplication, peer review (OpenAI) including the null-amendment regression-case write on drop, amendment insert to `pending_review`, regression case insert.
- `peer_reviewer_drops` writes on peer-review `false`.
- Proposer-quality telemetry writes to `amendment_proposer_metrics` on each emit.
- `correctionPatternDetectorJob` modification: add `failed_check_id + entity_type` clustering dimension.
- Amendments reach `pending_review` but no UI yet to act on them.

**Dependencies:** Step 2 (job exists, RCA validated), Step 1 (tables).

### Step 4 — Morning queue UI + accept/reject flows

- `ReviewQueuePage` amendment section band (§13.1).
- `AmendmentReviewDrawer` component (§13.2).
- All routes (§12): list, get, accept, accept-after-edit, reject.
- `skillAmendmentService`: `listPendingAmendments`, `getAmendment`, `accept`, `acceptAfterEdit`, `reject`.
- Regression replay job (`amendment:regression-replay`) wired to `accept()`.
- Audit event emission on accept / accept-after-edit / reject via `tryEmitAgentEvent` + `agent_execution_log_edits`.
- `manage_skill_amendments` permission key added and granted.

**Dependencies:** Steps 1–3 (amendments exist in `pending_review`).

### Step 5 — Skill detail + run trace UI + rollback + freeze switch

- SubaccountSkillsPage amendment stack expanded row (§13.3).
- RunTracePage composition panel (§13.4).
- Retire and rollback-class retire routes + service functions.
- Governance freeze switch UI on skill detail page.
- Freeze routes (§12): list, create, thaw.
- Asymmetric removal guard (§4.6 of dev brief): resolver fingerprints composed body against system-skill guardrails; alerts if any guardrail-shape element is contradicted.
- `review_required` state behaviour (per §7.8): proposer suppression (same path as `proposal_generation` freezes), orange badge in queue, skill detail warning banner. Clearing requires an operator to DELETE the freeze row (§12 thaw route).

**Dependencies:** Step 4 (UI foundation, service barrel exists).

### Step 6 — Evaluation harness

- `skill_amendment_effectiveness` update job (periodic daily).
- Freshness-window auto-retirement job (`amendment:stale-retire`): 14-day window, `retirement_reason = 'stale'`.
- Proposer-entropy telemetry writes to `amendment_proposer_entropy` monthly.
- Stack-health metrics computation (amendment_density, conflict_rate, rollback_rate, stale_ratio, edit_frequency, composition_size_trend) surfaced on skill detail page and org dashboard.
- Held-out human-labelled ground truth sample setup (operational process, not code — but the table hooks for divergence detection are wired here).

**Dependencies:** Steps 4–5 (accept/reject/retire flows, regression replay).

---

## 18. Execution-Safety Contracts

### 18.1 Idempotency posture

| Operation | Posture | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `failure_post_mortem` job execution (success path) | key-based | Unique constraint on `skill_amendments(scorecard_judgement_id)` WHERE status != 'retired'. Duplicate dispatch → `23505` caught → no-op. |
| `failure_post_mortem` job execution (peer-review drop path) | key-based (compound) | (a) `UNIQUE (scorecard_judgement_id)` on `peer_reviewer_drops` (§7.3); (b) `UNIQUE (scorecard_judgement_id) WHERE amendment_id IS NULL` partial on `skill_regression_cases` (§7.2). On retry after a drop, both writes hit `23505` and the job no-ops cleanly. |
| Amendment accept | state-based | `UPDATE skill_amendments SET status='accepted' WHERE id=$id AND status='pending_review'`. 0 rows updated = already actioned → 409. |
| Amendment acceptAfterEdit | state-based (compound) | Within one `withOrgTx` transaction: (1) `UPDATE skill_amendments SET status='retired', retirement_reason='superseded' WHERE id=$origId AND status='pending_review'` — if 0 rows updated, return 409 and DO NOT insert the replacement. (2) INSERT new row with `status='accepted'`, `superseded_by_amendment_id=NULL` on the new row, and `UPDATE` the original's `superseded_by_amendment_id` to point at the new row's id. Transaction rollback on any failure guarantees no orphaned replacement row. |
| Amendment reject | state-based | Same predicate, `status='pending_review'`. |
| Amendment retire | state-based | `UPDATE ... WHERE status='accepted'`. 0 rows = already retired → 409. |
| Regression replay job | key-based | One replay job per `amendment_id`; pg-boss key deduplication. |
| Freeze create | key-based | Unique partial index on `(org_id, scope, scope_id, freeze_type) NULLS NOT DISTINCT WHERE thawed_at IS NULL` (PostgreSQL 15+). The `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` clause is required because org-wide freezes have `scope_id = NULL` (§7.8); without it Postgres treats nulls as distinct and would allow duplicate active org freezes. Duplicate active freeze → 409. |
| Freeze thaw (DELETE route) | state-based | `UPDATE skill_amendment_freezes SET thawed_at=now(), thawed_by_user_id=$user WHERE id=$id AND thawed_at IS NULL`. 0 rows = already thawed → 409. |

### 18.2 Retry classification

| Operation | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `failure_post_mortem` job | safe | Idempotency key prevents duplicate amendment rows on retry |
| Peer review call (via `llmRouter`) | guarded | `llmRouter` applies its standard retry policy (up to 3 attempts, exponential backoff); idempotency key from `scorecard_judgement_id` is passed through as `idempotencyKey` on the `routeCall()` params and forwarded to the provider |
| Claude Opus RCA synthesis | guarded | Same retry budget; job-level idempotency prevents double insert |
| Amendment accept HTTP | unsafe | Caller must not retry without checking current status first |
| Resolver snapshot write (insert path) | safe | Write is idempotent on the benign-retry path: `ON CONFLICT (run_id, system_skill_id, org_skill_id) DO NOTHING ... RETURNING`. On `RETURNING`-empty, wrapper SELECTs existing row and compares; matching values continue, mismatching values raise `composition.divergence` (§18.7) — divergence is NOT retryable, the run is refused (§8.1 step 5) |

### 18.3 Concurrency guards for racing writes

- **Double-accept race:** Two concurrent accept requests for the same amendment → one wins (state-based predicate returns 1 row), other gets 0 rows → service returns 409. First caller's audit event is canonical.
- **Double-acceptAfterEdit race:** Two concurrent edit-accept requests on the same original amendment → both attempt the §18.1 compound transaction. The first to commit the `UPDATE original SET status='retired'` succeeds; the second sees 0 rows updated, returns 409, and the transaction rolls back so no orphaned replacement row is created. First caller's replacement row is canonical.
- **Accept + acceptAfterEdit race:** Both paths use the same state-based predicate on the original row (`status='pending_review'`). First commit wins; loser gets 409.
- **Accept during regression replay:** Regression replay job checks `status = 'accepted'` before running; if a parallel rollback fired and status is already `retired`, the replay job exits cleanly.
- **Double freeze race:** Unique partial index prevents two concurrent freeze creates for the same scope/type. Loser gets `23505` → 409.
- **Double-thaw race:** Two concurrent DELETE requests on the same freeze → state-based predicate `WHERE thawed_at IS NULL` matches once; second gets 0 rows → 409.

### 18.4 Terminal event guarantee

The `failure_post_mortem` job emits exactly one terminal log event per execution:
- `amendment.proposed` — amendment row written to `pending_review`
- `amendment.suppressed` — dedup match against active accepted or pending row
- `amendment.dropped.no_remedy` — proposer returned `no_remedy_proposed`
- `amendment.dropped.peer_review` — peer reviewer returned `false`
- `amendment.dropped.schema_invalid` — schema validation failed
- `amendment.dropped.cap_exceeded` — weekly or lifetime cap hit
- `amendment.dropped.freeze_active` — freeze gate blocked
- `amendment.dropped.custom_skill` — custom subaccount skill excluded
- `amendment.dropped.snapshot_missing` — no `skill_amendment_run_snapshot` row for the failed run (§9.1 step 4); indicates a synchronous-snapshot integrity failure on the originating run, not a best-effort loss; logged with `composition.degraded` alert
- `amendment.dropped.peer_review_unavailable` — peer review call (§9.1 step 10) exhausted `llmRouter` retries (provider timeout, 429/5xx after backoff, all-providers-down, router circuit-breaker open). After router exhaustion, the job no-ops cleanly with this terminal event rather than retrying indefinitely or proceeding without peer review — un-peer-reviewed amendments must never reach `pending_review`. Idempotent on retry: pg-boss redispatch hits the same dedup key (§9.1 idempotency) and either re-tries the router call (if a later attempt succeeds, the job proceeds normally) or re-emits this same terminal event. Alert: `proposer.peer_review_unavailable`

Post-terminal prohibition: no further events with the same `scorecard_judgement_id` after a terminal event from the same job run.

### 18.5 No-silent-partial-success

The `failure_post_mortem` job either completes fully (amendment in `pending_review`) or emits a `dropped` terminal event. There is no partial success path — if any step fails, the job retries from the start (idempotency key prevents double-insert).

### 18.6 State machine closure

**`skill_amendments.status` valid transitions:**

| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| (insert) | `accepted` | `acceptAfterEdit()` — new row inserted directly at `accepted` with full reviewer fields, `lineage_root_id`, and `superseded_by_amendment_id`-reverse-pointer set; bypasses `pending_review` (the operator's accept-on-edit IS the human review). |
| `draft` | `pending_review` | Proposer job transitions immediately after insert |
| `pending_review` | `accepted` | Operator accept action |
| `pending_review` | `rejected` | Operator reject action |
| `pending_review` | `retired` (`stale`) | Freshness-window job (14-day expiry, §9.3) |
| `pending_review` | `retired` (`superseded`) | Original row when `acceptAfterEdit()` creates a replacement row |
| `accepted` | `retired` | Operator retire; rollback; regression replay auto-rollback (§9.2); baseline reset |

Forbidden transitions: `rejected` → any; `retired` → any; `accepted` → `rejected` (regression replay must go through `retire` with `retirement_reason = 'rollback'`, see §9.2 step 3); `draft` → `accepted` (proposer-authored amendments must pass through `pending_review`; only `acceptAfterEdit()` inserts directly into `accepted` and that path is operator-driven, not proposer-driven).

The status enum is closed. Adding a new status value requires a spec amendment.

### 18.7 Typed resolution errors

The resolver wrapper raises typed errors that propagate to the agent boot path; the boot path refuses to start the run on any of these. Each is logged with structured fields so the alert payload is deterministic.

| Error | Raised when | Fields | Alert | Retryable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `composition.divergence` | §8.1 step 5 detects an existing snapshot row whose `composed_body_hash`, `included_amendment_ids`, `excluded_amendment_ids`, or `truncated` value differs from what the current pure-step run produced for the same `(run_id, system_skill_id, org_skill_id)` triple | `run_id`, `org_id`, `skill_id`, `existing_resolver_version`, `current_resolver_version`, `existing_hash`, `current_hash`, `included_diff`, `excluded_diff`, `truncated_diff` | `composition.degraded` | No — fail-closed; investigate before re-running |
| `composition.snapshot_write_failed` | §8.1 step 5 insert raises a non-conflict DB error (constraint, transient connection, etc.) | `run_id`, `org_id`, `skill_id`, `db_error_code`, `attempt_count` | `composition.degraded` | Yes — pg-boss / caller retry path; idempotent insert tolerates retry-after-success |

`composition.divergence` is the canonical "snapshot already exists but disagrees with what we just computed" exit. The two cases the wrapper is designed to distinguish are:
1. Benign retry after a successful prior insert — `RETURNING`-empty, `SELECT`ed values match recomputed values → resolution continues.
2. Genuine divergence — `RETURNING`-empty, `SELECT`ed values differ → resolution refused with `composition.divergence`, because the snapshot is the source of truth for the run that already started and there is no safe way to reconcile two different composed bodies for the same run.

The §9.1 step 4 RCA path treats `composition.divergence` as a non-target: an RCA cannot be grounded against a divergent snapshot because we cannot trust which composed body the run actually executed against.

## 20. Failure Atomicity Definitions

### Amendment acceptance

Sub-steps: DB write (`status = 'accepted'`, `activated_at`) → regression-set tag (`fix_proposed`) → cache invalidation → audit event emission → regression replay dispatch.

Atomicity boundary: DB write + regression-set tag are in a single `withOrgTx` transaction. Cache invalidation is synchronous after the transaction commits. Audit event is fire-and-forget via `tryEmitAgentEvent` (best-effort; failure does not roll back the accept). Regression replay dispatch is pg-boss `send` inside the transaction — rolls back with the transaction if the transaction fails.

If regression replay later fails: the amendment stays `accepted`; the job retries. If the replay job determines a regression: it transitions the amendment to `retired` (`retirement_reason = 'rollback'`) in a new transaction — the original accept transaction is not affected.

### Amendment retirement (including rollback)

Sub-steps: DB write (`status = 'retired'`, `retired_at`, `retirement_reason`) → cache invalidation → incident alert emission (rollback only) → audit event.

Atomicity: DB write in one transaction. Cache invalidation synchronous after commit. Alert and audit event are fire-and-forget. If alert fails: amendment is still retired; operator sees it in the skill detail page.

### Rollback (urgent retirement)

Same as retirement but additionally: emits an operational incident event (separate from the morning queue), surfaces at tier 1 in the queue, captures audit trail (operator, telemetry signal, affected runs). Incident emission is fire-and-forget — if it fails, the rollback DB write has already committed.

### Regression replay

Sub-steps: Load regression cases → replay each case via bench primitives → score → check for regressions → (if regression) auto-retire amendment → write effectiveness sidecar.

If any replay sub-step fails: the job retries from the top (idempotent — `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on sidecar writes; amendment status check prevents double-retire). If the auto-retire sub-step fails: the amendment stays `accepted`; the job retries; an alert is emitted.

### Freshness-window auto-retirement

Sub-steps: Query `pending_review` rows older than 14 days → batch update to `status = 'retired', retirement_reason = 'stale'` → write `amendment_proposer_metrics` update.

Atomic per row. If the job crashes mid-batch: already-retired rows have `retirement_reason = 'stale'`; unprocessed rows are retried on the next daily run. No duplicate retirements possible (state-based predicate: `WHERE status = 'pending_review' AND created_at < now() - interval '14 days'`).

---

## 21. Testing Posture

Per `docs/spec-context.md`: `testing_posture: static_gates_primary`, `runtime_tests: pure_function_only`, `frontend_tests: none_for_now`.

- **Resolver composition logic** (`composeAmendmentsPure` — ordering, fail-closed truncation, `context_fact` declarative-only check, `validateAmendmentBody`) — pure function tests via Vitest. The `resolveSkillsForAgent` wrapper (DB query + snapshot write) is not unit-tested at this level; covered by the existing skill-resolution integration paths.
- **Amendment status machine** (valid/forbidden transitions) — pure unit tests.
- **Deduplication hash logic** (`normalised_body` computation) — pure unit test.
- **Anti-recursion gate** (rejects amendments targeting evaluator surfaces) — pure unit test.
- **Proposer job handler** — not unit-tested (LLM call + pg-boss). Covered by the Step 2 sanity gate (manual inspection of real RCA outputs on 10 internal fail verdicts before Step 3 is wired).
- No API contract tests, no E2E tests, no frontend tests. Static gates (`verify-rls-coverage.sh`, `verify-rls-contract-compliance.sh`) enforce RLS presence.

---

## 22. Deferred Items

- **Surface B: cross-subaccount org-admin roll-up queue.** The org-admin persona's cross-workspace queue view is deferred. Phase 1 delivers Surface A (in-workspace queue per subaccount). Surface B requires the same underlying data but a different query and permission shape; it is low-risk to add post-Phase 1. Reason: Phase 1 prioritises proving the loop works in a single subaccount before scaling to the roll-up view.
- **`learned_failure_mode` memory entry type.** Deferred to Phase 2. Nothing in Phase 1 reads this entry type back into agent runtime context. RCA records on `skill_amendments.rca_json` provide Phase 1 provenance. Reason: the memory layer entry type and its decay policy deserve a separate spec section once Phase 1 has validated the RCA output quality.
- **Upward promotion to system tier.** Requires ring rollout primitive (separate brief: `tasks/research-briefs/staged-rollout-dev-brief.md`). The schema supports it (`source = 'promoted_from_subaccount'` enum value); the promotion path is not built.
- **Org-scoped amendments (fan-out writing path).** Schema supports org scope; proposer does not write org-scoped rows in Phase 1. No UI exposes them.
- **Shadow-mode simulation.** Amendments surfaced directly after peer review passes. Simulation against historical runs before surfacing is deferred until replay infrastructure matures and queue volume proves to be the bottleneck.
- **Auto-retirement of low-value amendments.** Effectiveness state (§7.4) surfaces candidates; the operator decides in Phase 1. Auto-retirement is a Phase 2 escalation.
- **Amendment portability.** What travels with a cloned/exported/templated skill (amendments? provenance? regression set?) is undefined in Phase 1. Schema does not block portability; policy is not written yet.
- **Cross-subaccount pattern detection.** Deferred per tenant isolation invariant (§6.5); requires a separate brief.
- **Correction-cluster sidecar table + read path.** Phase 1's amendment proposer is triggered by `scorecard_judgement_id` only (§9.1). The `originating_correction_cluster_id` column exists in `skill_amendments` but is always NULL in Phase 1. Phase 2 will add a `correction_clusters` table (sidecar for the correction-pattern detector), backfill the FK constraint on `originating_correction_cluster_id`, and add a cluster-triggered branch to `failure_post_mortem`. Reason: cluster-triggered proposals are an escalation path that needs the Phase 1 failure-mode-triggered loop validated first.
- **Evaluator Stress Test integration.** The EST gaming-statistic computation (`G(y)`) for amendment-gaming detection is deferred to Phase 2. Phase 1 has peer review and the held-out regression set as the primary defences.
- **Periodic baseline reset automation.** Quarterly merge of stable amendments into the system skill is an operational process in Phase 1 (not automated code). Phase 2 consideration if volume justifies it.
- **Multi-instance resolver cache invalidation.** Phase 1's resolver cache (§8.4) is in-process (per-instance `Map`) and is correct under the pre-production single-instance posture (`docs/spec-context.md` `rollout_model: commit_and_revert`). When horizontal scaling lands in Phase 2, the cache will need an explicit multi-instance invalidation contract (shared `amendment_version_set_hash` computation site, cross-instance invalidation on amendment status transitions, and a stale-read boundary spec). Reason: stale-read tolerance under multi-instance deployment is a separate design decision that doesn't gate the Phase 1 closed-loop functionality.

## 23. Self-Consistency Pass

- **Goals ↔ Implementation:** All 8 Goals in §2 map to explicit implementation sections (resolver: §8; proposer job: §9.1; regression replay: §9.2; morning queue UI: §13.1–13.2; skill detail UI: §13.3; run trace UI: §13.4; freeze switch: §7.8 + §13; evaluation harness: §9.2 + §17 Step 6). No goal is prose-only.
- **Non-goals encoded:** Surface B deferred to §22. `learned_failure_mode` deferred to §22. Autonomous activation prohibited by §18.1 (state-based predicate requires explicit operator action).
- **Count reconciliation:** 8 new tables (§7.1–7.8). 4 new jobs (§9.1–9.4). 2 modified jobs (§10.1–10.2). 1 new service (§11). 10 new routes (§12). 4 client change areas (§13.1–13.4). File inventory lock: see §17 Phase Sequencing steps for complete file list per step.
- **Load-bearing claims verified:**
  - "Amendments never activate without operator approval" — enforced by state machine (§18.6): `pending_review → accepted` requires explicit `accept()` call from a route handler guarded by `requirePermission('manage_skill_amendments')`.
  - "Proposer never sees the regression set" — enforced by §19 trust boundary: proposer context inputs (§9.1 step 5) are listed explicitly and do not include `skill_regression_cases`.
  - "Resolver composition step is deterministic" — §6.6 and §8.1: `composeAmendmentsPure` has no mutable external service calls, no model calls, no wall-clock time. The `resolveSkillsForAgent` wrapper performs the snapshot DB write as a synchronous, awaited side effect outside the pure boundary; snapshot-write failures propagate as typed resolution errors (`composition.snapshot_write_failed` retryable, `composition.divergence` non-retryable — §18.7). On `RETURNING`-empty the wrapper compares the existing snapshot against the recomputed values rather than silently accepting either; divergence is fail-closed (§8.1 step 5).
  - "RLS enforces org boundary" — §14: all tenant-scoped tables use `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `getOrgScopedDb` service-layer gate.
- **Phase dependency graph:** Step 1 (schema) ← Step 2 (RCA job) ← Step 3 (proposer + peer review) ← Step 4 (UI + accept/reject) ← Step 5 (skill detail + freeze) ← Step 6 (harness). No backward references detected.
- **Execution model consistent:** All async operations are pg-boss queued; all HTTP route handlers are synchronous returns; resolver is inline synchronous. No mixed-model operations.

## 24. Open Questions

None. All design decisions were resolved during the grill-me Q&A (see `tasks/builds/closed-loop-skill-improvement/intent.md § Grill-me Q&A`) and the dev brief §7 (all questions marked CLOSED at brief-lock time).
