## 1. Goal + non-goals

### Goal

Make the dispatcher and execution loops resist race conditions and contract gaps that surface only under sustained testing — close the 5 truly-open execution-path correctness items before the testing round runs.

After Chunk 5 lands:

- Dispatcher boundaries re-check invalidation after every awaited I/O (invariant 3.1).
- Multi-webhook resolutions are rejected at dispatch (invariant 3.3 / W1-43 rule 4).
- `errorMessage` is threaded into memory extraction on normal-path failed runs (invariant 3.6).
- `runResultStatus = 'partial'` is decoupled from summary presence (invariant 3.5 + 6.3).
- Skill error envelope shape is one of two documented options with 100% adherence (invariant 2.4).

### Non-goals

- Adding new step types or new dispatcher branches.
- Changing the §5.7 error vocabulary beyond what W1-38's resolution already accomplished (verified closed; see § 2.1).
- Reworking the tick loop's scheduler / queue semantics. Chunk 5 stays inside the existing loop shape.
- Anything in mini-spec § "Out of scope" (LAEL-P1-1, TEST-HARNESS, etc.).

## 2. Items closed

### 2.1 Already-closed items — verified state on 2026-04-26

| Mini-spec ID | todo.md line | Verbatim snippet | Verified state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `W1-44` | 649 | "REQ W1-44 — Pre-dispatch connection resolution not implemented" | `server/services/invokeAutomationStepService.ts:128` resolves `automation.requiredConnections`; missing keys fail with `code: 'automation_missing_connection'` at dispatch (lines 130–155). **CLOSED.** |
| `W1-38` | 651 | "REQ W1-38 engine-not-found — dispatcher emits `automation_execution_error`, not in §5.7 vocabulary (ambiguous)" | `grep -rE "automation_execution_error" server/` → no matches. The engine-not-found case now emits `automation_not_found` (line 95) and the engine-load-failed case emits `automation_composition_invalid` (line 162). The ambiguous code is gone. **CLOSED.** |

### 2.2 Truly-open items — closed by this spec

| Mini-spec ID | todo.md line | Verbatim snippet | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C4b-INVAL-RACE` | 667 | "Inline-dispatch step handlers do not re-check invalidation after awaiting external I/O" (Codex iter 3 finding #7) | Add a re-read + invalidation-check wrapper around every `*Internal` helper call that follows an `await` on external I/O in `workflowEngineService.ts`. Single helper `withInvalidationGuard(stepRunId, work)` wraps the late-write to discard if `status === 'invalidated'`. See § 4 for scope decision. |
| `W1-43` | 648 | "REQ W1-43 — Dispatcher §5.10a rule 4 defence-in-depth not implemented" | Add a pure-function assertion inside `resolveDispatch` (`server/services/invokeAutomationStepService.ts`) that verifies the automation row conforms to the single-webhook contract: exactly one non-empty `webhookPath`, no alternative webhook fields. Emits `automation_composition_invalid` on violation. |
| `HERMES-S1` | 92–105 | "§6.8 errorMessage gap on normal-path failed runs" — `agentExecutionService.ts:1350-1368` passes `errorMessage: null` into `extractRunInsights` even when `derivedRunResultStatus === 'failed'` | Thread `errorMessage` from `preFinalizeMetadata` (already in scope at line 1370) into `extractRunInsights` when the derived status is `failed`. The current code at line ~1659 explicitly says `errorMessage: null as string | null,` with a "future refactor could surface" comment — that's the resolution. |
| `H3-PARTIAL-COUPLING` | 152–171 | "H3 — `runResultStatus='partial'` coupling to summary presence" — `computeRunResultStatus` line 572 demotes `completed` → `partial` when `!hasSummary` | Per architect decision: pick option (a) separate `hasSummary` flag, OR (b) side-channel `summaryMissing=true`, OR (c) monitor-and-revisit. § 4 below recommends (b) — keep `runResultStatus` purely about task outcome; surface `summaryMissing` as a side-channel field on the run row. |
| `C4a-6-RETSHAPE` | 337 | "REQ #C4a-6 — Return-shape contract for delegation errors" — spec §4.3 mandates `{ code, message, context }`; ~40 skills return `error: <string>` | **DEPENDS ON CHUNK 2 ARCHITECT OUTPUT.** The Chunk 2 architect resolves whether to grandfather the flat-string pattern or migrate to the nested envelope (per invariant 2.4). § 4 below documents both branches; the spec ships against whichever Chunk 2 picks. |

## 3. Items NOT closed

| What | Why deferred | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Adding new step types or step-run statuses | Out of scope; `shared/runStatus.ts` sets are closed per invariant 6.5 | Future spec if needed |

## 4. Key decisions

### 4.1 C4b-INVAL-RACE — single helper vs per-call-site (resolved inline)

**Decision: single helper `withInvalidationGuard`.**

Mini-spec poses: "scope of the invalidation re-check wrapper (one helper or per-call-site)". The single-helper approach wins because:

- DRY across the 4 internal-helper call sites (`action_call`, `agent_call`, `prompt`, `invoke_automation`).
- Mirrors the public `completeStepRun` / `completeStepRunFromReview` pattern (already centralised).
- Easier to test (one pure-function unit covers the race).
- New step types added later automatically inherit the protection.

Helper shape (in `server/services/workflowEngineService.ts`):

```typescript
async function withInvalidationGuard<T>(
  stepRunId: string,
  externalWork: () => Promise<T>,
): Promise<T | { discarded: true; reason: 'invalidated' }> {
  const result = await externalWork();
  const [sr] = await db.select().from(workflowStepRuns).where(eq(workflowStepRuns.id, stepRunId)).limit(1);
  if (sr?.status === 'invalidated') {
    return { discarded: true, reason: 'invalidated' };
  }
  return result;
}
```

Call sites: each `*Internal` helper that performs an `await` on external I/O (action_call's tool dispatch, agent_call's sub-run trigger, prompt's LLM call, invoke_automation's webhook) wraps the I/O in `withInvalidationGuard(stepRun.id, ...)`. If the result is `{ discarded: true }`, the late-write skips and the outer step state stays `invalidated`.

### 4.2 H3-PARTIAL-COUPLING — chosen option (resolved inline)

**Decision: option (b) side-channel `summaryMissing=true`.**

Three options from `tasks/todo.md:162-170`:
- (a) Separate `hasSummary` flag column on `agent_runs` — schema change; risks invariant 2.6 (schema landings under Chunk 2).
- (b) Side-channel `summaryMissing=true` — no schema change; informational field only; preserves `runResultStatus` semantics.
- (c) Monitor-and-revisit — kicks the can; conflicts with invariant 3.5 ("summary failure must not demote a successful run").

(b) wins because:

- No schema change; ships in the implementation PR without coordinating with Chunk 2.
- Invariant 3.5 is closed (success runs without summaries no longer get demoted to partial).
- The side-channel field can be a key on `runMetadata` JSONB or returned only in the response shape — no DDL.

`computeRunResultStatus` signature changes to:

```typescript
export function computeRunResultStatus(
  finalStatus: string,
  hasError: boolean,
  hadUncertainty: boolean,
): 'success' | 'partial' | 'failed';
// hasSummary parameter removed; partial reachable ONLY from per-step aggregation per invariant 6.3
```

Callers that need to surface "summary missing" do so via a separate field on the response/extraction shape.

### 4.3 C4a-6-RETSHAPE — Chunk 5 owns this decision (recommendation: Branch A grandfather)

**Ownership resolution.** The cross-spec consistency sweep (Task 6.6) surfaced unowned-decision drift between Chunks 2 / 3 / 5: each chunk pointed at another for the C4a-6-RETSHAPE decision. The Chunk 2 architect output covered schema decisions and renames; C4a-6-RETSHAPE is an execution-path concern and lives in Chunk 5. This spec now owns it.

**Recommendation: Branch A — grandfather the flat-string pattern.** Rationale:

- Pre-launch posture (`docs/spec-context.md § Architecture defaults`): rapid_evolution, prefer existing primitives, no introduce-then-defer.
- Migrating ~40 skill handlers from `error: '<code-string>'` to `error: { code, message, context }` is high-effort low-value pre-launch — every handler ships pre-launch with a minor refactor for no direct testing-round benefit.
- The 3 delegation skills (`spawn_sub_agents`, `reassign_task`, third per `tasks/todo.md:337`) bring their return shapes back to align with the legacy flat-string pattern. The amendment to `docs/hierarchical-delegation-dev-spec.md` §4.3 documents the legacy pattern as canonical for v1.
- Branch B (migrate) becomes a Phase-2 spec when explicit operator value emerges (e.g., LLM-facing serialisation needs richer error context). Trigger documented in § 10 Deferred Items.

User can override at PR review (§ Review Residuals captures this as a HITL question — recommendation flagged but not enforced).

Branches documented for completeness:

**Branch A — grandfather the flat-string pattern (RECOMMENDED):**
- No code change to ~40 existing skill handlers.
- Spec § 4.3 of `docs/hierarchical-delegation-dev-spec.md` is amended to acknowledge the legacy pattern.
- Three delegation skills (`spawn_sub_agents`, `reassign_task`, third per spec) bring their return shape into alignment with the legacy flat-string pattern.

**Branch B — migrate all skills to nested envelope (alternative):**
- All ~40 skill handlers refactor `error: '<code-string>'` to `error: { code: '<code-string>', message: '...', context: {...} }`.
- LLM-facing serialisation, agent prompt parsing, `executeWithActionAudit` audit log all updated.
- Bigger code change; bigger payoff (consistent error envelope across the platform).

Implementation PR ships against Branch A by default; if user picks Branch B at review, implementation PR scope expands.

### 4.4 W1-43 rule 4 implementation (resolved inline)

**Decision: pure-function assertion in `resolveDispatch`.**

The current code at line 162 already validates "engine assigned" → `automation_composition_invalid`. Add a sibling check before that branch:

```typescript
function assertSingleWebhook(automation: AutomationRow): null | AutomationStepError {
  const webhookFields = [
    automation.webhookPath,
    // ...any future multi-webhook fields the spec rejects
  ].filter((v) => v != null && v !== '');
  if (webhookFields.length !== 1) {
    return {
      code: 'automation_composition_invalid',
      type: 'execution',
      message: `Automation '${automation.id}' must have exactly one outbound webhook; found ${webhookFields.length}.`,
      retryable: false,
    };
  }
  return null;
}
```

Today the schema enforces single-webhook implicitly via the `webhookPath` text column shape. The assertion catches mutated / migrated rows where the contract was violated by a non-schema path.

## 5. Files touched

### Modified

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `server/services/workflowEngineService.ts` | Add `withInvalidationGuard` helper. Wrap each `*Internal` helper's external-I/O await with the guard. |
| `server/services/invokeAutomationStepService.ts` | Add `assertSingleWebhook` pure helper. Call before engine-load (current line 162). |
| `server/services/agentExecutionService.ts` | Thread `errorMessage` from `preFinalizeMetadata` into `extractRunInsights` call (current line ~1659). Replace `errorMessage: null as string | null,` with `errorMessage: derivedRunResultStatus === 'failed' ? extractErrorMessage(preFinalizeMetadata) : null,`. |
| `server/services/agentExecutionServicePure.ts` | Refactor `computeRunResultStatus` per § 4.2: remove `hasSummary` parameter; partial reachable only from per-step aggregation. Update callers in `agentExecutionService.ts`. |
| Spec doc `docs/hierarchical-delegation-dev-spec.md` | (Branch A only — if Chunk 2 picks grandfather) §4.3 amendment to acknowledge legacy flat-string pattern. |
| ~40 skill handlers in `server/services/skillExecutor.ts` and the skill modules it dispatches to | (Branch B only — if Chunk 2 picks migrate) refactor each `error: '<code-string>'` return to nested envelope. Enumerate during implementation. |

### Created

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server/services/__tests__/invalidationRaceP​ure.test.ts` (or co-located) | Pure simulation test for C4b: concurrent invalidate + dispatch result; asserts late writer hard-discards. |
| `server/services/__tests__/assertSingleWebhookPure.test.ts` | Pure test for W1-43: zero / one / multiple webhook fields. |
| `server/services/__tests__/computeRunResultStatusPure.test.ts` (or extension) | Pure test for H3 + invariant 6.3: all-completed → success; any-error → failed/partial; cancelled / skipped aggregation; summary absence does NOT demote. |
| `server/services/__tests__/extractRunInsightsErrorMessagePure.test.ts` | Pure test for HERMES-S1: failed-without-throw runs receive threaded errorMessage. |

### Untouched (verification-only — no code change)

- `server/services/invokeAutomationStepService.ts` lines 95 (engine-not-found), 128–155 (required-connection check), 162–168 (engine-load) — verified correct per § 2.1.
- `shared/runStatus.ts` — sets are closed per invariant 6.5; no changes here.

---

## 6. Implementation Guardrails

### MUST reuse

- `failure() + FailureReason enum` (`shared/iee/failure.ts`) for any new error path (per `accepted_primitives`).
- `shared/runStatus.ts` `TERMINAL_RUN_STATUSES` / `IN_FLIGHT_RUN_STATUSES` / `AWAITING_RUN_STATUSES` — single source of truth (invariant 6.5).
- `agentExecutionEventService` for any new event emission.
- Existing `*Internal` helper shape in `workflowEngineService.ts` — wrap, don't replace.

### MUST NOT introduce

- New step types or new run statuses without a `runStatus.ts` update + spec amendment (invariant 6.5).
- A new "WorkflowEngineFramework" or "DispatcherBase" abstraction. The single-helper approach in § 4.1 is the framework.
- New `error_code` strings outside §5.7 vocabulary (invariant 3.4).
- Vitest / Jest / Playwright / Supertest. Pure tests only (per `convention_rejections`).
- A schema column for H3 — the side-channel option (b) deliberately avoids DDL (§ 4.2).

### Known fragile areas

- **`withInvalidationGuard` re-read cost.** Each external-I/O await now incurs an extra SELECT on `workflow_step_runs`. The query is indexed by primary key; cost is negligible. Confirm at implementation time by EXPLAIN.
- **`computeRunResultStatus` signature change.** `hasSummary` parameter removed. Audit every caller; the typecheck will surface them. Implementation PR includes the call-site updates.
- **Branch B (skill error envelope migrate).** ~40 skills return error strings. Audit each; LLM-facing serialisation may need updates. The spec calls out this risk in § Review Residuals.

## 6.5 Pre-implementation hardening (execution-safety contracts)

Folded in 2026-04-26 from external review feedback.

### 6.5.1 No-silent-partial-success per execution flow

Per invariant 7.4, every flow surfaces an explicit terminal `status: 'success' | 'partial' | 'failed'`.

- **C4b-INVAL-RACE (`withInvalidationGuard`):** **Idempotency posture (per invariant 7.1):** `state-based`. **Retry classification (per invariant 7.5):** `guarded`. Late writer that finds `status === 'invalidated'` returns `{ discarded: true, reason: 'invalidated' }` — explicit signal, NOT silent. The caller logs the discard via `step.dispatch.invalidation_discarded` (see § 6.5.2) and the run's outcome reflects the invalidation per `runStatus.ts`. Source of truth (invariant 7.2): the `workflow_step_runs.status` row is authoritative; the late writer never overwrites a terminal state.
- **W1-43 (`assertSingleWebhook`):** **Idempotency posture:** `state-based`. **Retry classification (per invariant 7.5):** `safe` (the assertion is pure; no side effects). Multi-webhook input emits `automation_composition_invalid` with the count in the message. Step transitions to `error` — never silent. Status enum: `failed`.
- **HERMES-S1 (errorMessage threading):** **Idempotency posture:** `non-idempotent (intentional)`. **Retry classification (per invariant 7.5):** `unsafe` (memory extraction has side effects in `memory_blocks`; guarded upstream by terminal-state idempotency — terminal-state transition is one-way, so the extraction fires at most once per run). Failed-without-throw runs receive the threaded `errorMessage` from `preFinalizeMetadata`; memory extraction sees a non-null value. The "silent" path the bug created (extraction skipped because errorMessage was null) is explicitly closed.
- **H3-PARTIAL-COUPLING:** **Idempotency posture:** `state-based`. **Retry classification (per invariant 7.5):** `safe` (pure computation; no side effects). `runResultStatus` reflects the per-step aggregation rule from invariant 6.3 ONLY. Summary absence is surfaced via the orthogonal `summaryMissing` side-channel field, never via `runResultStatus = 'partial'`. Both signals visible to the consumer; user-facing surface chooses which to display. Status enum mapping: `runResultStatus = 'success'` → status: 'success'; `'partial'` → 'partial'; `'failed'` → 'failed'.
- **C4a-6-RETSHAPE (Branch A):** **Idempotency posture:** `non-idempotent (intentional)`. **Retry classification (per invariant 7.5):** `unsafe` (skill handlers may have side effects; re-dispatch is governed upstream by Chunk 3 § 4.5.2 optimistic guard). Every skill handler error matches the legacy flat-string shape `{ success: false, error: '<code-string>', context }`. No partial envelopes. Branch B (if user picks at review) requires every handler to match the nested shape `{ success: false, error: { code, message, context } }` — fixture test asserts.

### 6.5.2 Observability hooks

The `agentExecutionEventService` is the canonical primitive (per invariant 6.5 / `accepted_primitives`). Per invariant 7.3, every event in a single execution chain carries the same `runId` (or `stepRunId` for step-level events). Cross-flow trace reconstruction filters on a single key.

Required emissions for the 5 closed items:

- **C4b-INVAL-RACE:** terminal event (per invariant 7.7) is `step.dispatch.completed | step.dispatch.invalidation_discarded | step.dispatch.failed`:
  - `step.dispatch.started` (runId, stepRunId, stepType)
  - `step.dispatch.completed` (runId, stepRunId, durationMs, outputBytes, status: 'success') — TERMINAL on dispatch success
  - `step.dispatch.invalidation_discarded` (runId, stepRunId, status: 'success', discarded: true) — TERMINAL when guard fires after I/O
  - `step.dispatch.failed` (runId, stepRunId, error, status: 'failed') — TERMINAL on dispatch failure
- **W1-43:**
  - `step.dispatch.composition_invalid` (runId, stepRunId, automationId, webhookCount, status: 'failed') — TERMINAL when `assertSingleWebhook` returns error (folds into the `step.dispatch.failed` family)
- **HERMES-S1:**
  - `run.terminal.extracted_with_errorMessage` (runId, errorMessageLength) — emitted ONLY when threading occurs (failed run + non-null errorMessage)
- **H3:**
  - `run.terminal.summary_missing` (runId, runResultStatus) — emitted ONLY when `summaryMissing=true` so consumers can correlate
- **C4a-6-RETSHAPE:**
  - No new emission; the existing skill-execution event already carries error envelope. Branch B implementation adds shape-validation in the emission helper if migrating.

Best-effort emission via `agentExecutionEventService` (graded-failure tier).

### 6.5.3 Webhook timeout posture (cross-reference)

Chunk 3 § 4.5.5 pins the 30-second webhook timeout + retry posture for `invokeAutomationStep`. That contract is binding for Chunk 5's W1-43 / W1-44 dispatcher boundary too — the dispatcher emits `automation_webhook_timeout` (or `automation_missing_connection` for W1-44) with the same failure-classification rules. Cross-spec consistency: the timeout is implemented once in `invokeAutomationStep`, both Chunks 3 + 5 cite it.

---

## 7. Test plan

### Pure unit tests (4 files per § 5)

1. **C4b invalidation race** — set up: stepRun in `running`, simulate concurrent invalidation (mock the SELECT to return `status: 'invalidated'` after the await), assert late write returns `{ discarded: true, reason: 'invalidated' }` and the row stays `invalidated`.
2. **W1-43 single-webhook assertion** — three cases: zero webhooks (returns error), one webhook (returns null), two webhooks (returns error with `automation_composition_invalid`).
3. **H3 + invariant 6.3 aggregation** — all-completed → success; any-error → failed; cancelled aggregation; skipped aggregation; partial reachable only via per-step mix; summary absence does NOT demote.
4. **HERMES-S1 errorMessage threading** — failed run with `preFinalizeMetadata.errorMessage='X'` → `extractRunInsights` receives `errorMessage: 'X'`. Failed run with no errorMessage → null. Success run → null regardless.

### Static gates

- `verify-rls-contract-compliance.sh` → must pass (no direct `db` use changes).
- TypeScript build → must pass (signature change for `computeRunResultStatus` surfaces all callers).
- Sanity grep before commit: `grep -rE "automation_execution_error" server/` → must remain zero (W1-38 closed).

### Branch A vs Branch B test deltas

If Chunk 2 picks **Branch B** (migrate skill error envelope):
- Add a fixture-based test that iterates the registered skill handlers and asserts every error return matches the nested `{ code, message, context }` shape.

If Chunk 2 picks **Branch A** (grandfather):
- No additional test; `docs/hierarchical-delegation-dev-spec.md` §4.3 amendment is the deliverable.

## 8. Done criteria

- [ ] `withInvalidationGuard` helper present in `workflowEngineService.ts`; all 4 internal-helper external-I/O awaits wrapped.
- [ ] `assertSingleWebhook` present in `invokeAutomationStepService.ts`; called before engine-load; emits `automation_composition_invalid` on violation.
- [ ] `agentExecutionService.ts` line ~1659 threads `errorMessage` from `preFinalizeMetadata` for failed-without-throw runs.
- [ ] `computeRunResultStatus` no longer accepts `hasSummary`; partial reachable only via per-step aggregation; all callers updated.
- [ ] C4a-6-RETSHAPE: implementation matches whichever branch (A or B) Chunk 2 architect picked.
- [ ] 4 pure unit tests per § 5 land green.
- [ ] `tasks/todo.md` annotated for all 7 cited items per § 8.
- [ ] PR body links the spec; test plan checked off.

---

## 9. Rollback notes

- `withInvalidationGuard` — additive helper; rollback via `git revert`. Internal helpers fall back to no re-check.
- `assertSingleWebhook` — additive; rollback restores pre-check behaviour (schema still enforces single-webhook implicitly).
- HERMES-S1 errorMessage threading — single-line diff at line 1659; rollback restores `errorMessage: null`.
- H3 `computeRunResultStatus` signature change — bigger blast radius (every caller). Rollback restores `hasSummary` parameter; partial-from-no-summary returns. Acceptable because pre-Chunk-5 state is the current production state.
- C4a-6-RETSHAPE Branch A: spec doc revert. Branch B: ~40 file revert; bigger lift.

No DB migrations involved.

---

## 10. Deferred Items

None for Chunk 5.

The 5 truly-open items in § 2.2 are all closed; the 2 verified-closed items in § 2.1 require no spec action; the C4a-6-RETSHAPE branching is documented in § 4.3 but blocks on Chunk 2.

---

## 11. Review Residuals

_(Populated by user adjudication at PR review. `spec-reviewer` agent skipped per `tasks/builds/pre-launch-hardening-specs/progress.md § Workflow deviations`.)_

### HITL decisions (user must answer)

- **C4a-6-RETSHAPE branch.** Confirm Chunk 2 architect picked Branch A (grandfather flat-string) or Branch B (migrate to nested envelope). Implementation cannot start the C4a-6-RETSHAPE work until this is locked.

### Directional uncertainties (explicitly accepted tradeoffs)

- **H3 option choice.** § 4.2 picks option (b) side-channel. Trade-off: rejected option (a) schema-flag (cleaner long-term but introduces DDL during a chunk that explicitly avoids schema work) and option (c) monitor-and-revisit (kicks the can; conflicts with invariant 3.5). Accepted; if option (a) is preferred, the spec is amended and Chunk 2 picks up the schema column.
- **C4b single-helper scope.** § 4.1 picks single helper over per-call-site. Trade-off: rejected per-call-site as noisier and harder to audit. Accepted.
